HARARE - ZPC Kariba coach Sunday &ldquo;Mhofu&rdquo; Chidzambwa was yesterday involved in a freak accident that torched a social media storm and left the former Warriors gaffer distraught. Eye witnesses said Chidzambwa escaped unhurt when a Honda Fit he was travelling in went off the road, hitting a pedestrian before finally coming to rest after it had scaled onto a house in the high density suburb of Nyamhunga early yesterday morning. When the Daily News contacted Chidzambwa to set the record straight, he paused for a moment before directing the paper to his superiors. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak right now, talk to the secretary (Robert Mamvura),&rdquo; he said. Mamvura in turn, said: &ldquo;I heard about the incident but I am out of office at the moment, you can get a comment from ZPC spokesperson.&rdquo; News of the accident continued to torch a social storm which morphed into wild allegations, forcing ZPC Kariba spokesperson Fadzai Chisveto to release a statement last night clearing the air regarding the circumstances of the crash. &ldquo;On the April 12, 2017 at around 06;30 hours . . . Chidzambwa was involved in a road traffic accident in Nyamhunga 2, Kariba,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The coach was a passenger in a vehicle on his way from routine training. The driver lost control of the vehicle, swerved to the extreme left of the road and hit a pedestrian before it hit the corner of one of the properties on the street of Nyamhunga.&rdquo; She also gave an update on the condition of the pedestrian caught up in the accident. &ldquo;The pedestrian, Courage Ndoroyerwizi&rsquo;s condition is stable and there is no threat to life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He sustained a bruise on his right knee and a cut on the right thumb and has been treated and discharged. The ZPC coach did not sustain any injuries.&rdquo; At the time of going to print last night, police were making necessary inquiries as to the cause of the accident and the outcome will be communicated, she added.
