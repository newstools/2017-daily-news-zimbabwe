HARARE - Songbird&nbsp; Plaxedes Wenyika, who was among the first crop of urban grooves artistes to hit the scene around the year 2000, believes her just-released single, Now I know will torch the spirit of love alight. Wenyika dropped her latest offering yesterday two years after her last single Munhu Wangu. &ldquo;I hope the song takes people back to the basics of love, the emotions, not just the physical. When I sat down with Mcdee (producer Mcdonald Chidavaenzi), I said I wanted to get back to soul music, the good love songs and I feel we achieved that with this song,&rdquo; Wenyika told the Daily News. The popular songstress, who scaled down her involvement in music after marrying Mike Joka in 2004, has promised to release more music this year. &ldquo;Art is about inspiration and I feel I am in a good inspirational space right now. I am going to be doing at least one (song) every two months all building up to my sixth album,&rdquo; she said. As a gesture of gratitude to her loyal fans, the Tisaparadzane hit-maker is giving away the new single for free. &ldquo;We are giving it away for free. People just come on my website and send us an email and we send them the song. &ldquo;There is a lot of piracy sometimes because people don&rsquo;t have access to the music, so we are saying let&rsquo;s give people the music and thank them for being faithful to my music. They should not be struggling to get it,&rdquo; said Wenyika. The amiable songtress, who has hardly held any shows over the last decade, has lined various shows to connect with her fans including a concert at Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise on April 28.
