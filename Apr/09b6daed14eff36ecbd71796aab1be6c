HARARE - Barely a day after releasing the video for Sendekera, his collaboration with South African powerhouse, Mafikizolo, Jah Prayzah has announced plans to collaborate with Nigerian music star Davido. Though details about the collaboration were still sketchy yesterday, the Watora Mari singer and Davido confirmed the impending duet on YouTube. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going down Nigeria, Zimbabwe, we are about to do something crazy...,&rdquo; Davido said with Jah Prayzah concurring. The Jerusarema singer is currently in South Africa where he agreed on the collaboration with the internationally-acclaimed Skelewu singer who performed in Zimbabwe in August 2015 courtesy of Chipaz Promotions. The popular Davido is one of the most expensive and flamboyant artistes on the African continent. According to rates previously availed by HKN Music, co-owned by Davido and his elder brother Ade, to a Zimbabwean promoter, it costs at least $100 000&nbsp; to hire the Nigerian music star and his 12 member-strong&nbsp; band. Additionally, the interested promoter has to pay for five business class air tickets and seven economy class tickets as well as two executive suites and 10 standard rooms. Once in the host country, Davido demands two SUVs and a luxury bus as well as two personal body guards. The hiring promoter is also obliged to pay a daily per diem of $100 for all the 12 members of Davido&rsquo;s band. If the Nigerian star only brings a DJ instead of a full band, he has to part with $60 000. Early this week during a visit to the Big Brother Naija House, the Nigerian superstar claimed that he spent millions of dollars in a year. He said: &ldquo;I spent $1 million in 3 months!&rdquo; The Nigerian star owns a fleet of expensive brands such Porsche Carrera, Rolls Royce Phantom and Mercedes Benz.
