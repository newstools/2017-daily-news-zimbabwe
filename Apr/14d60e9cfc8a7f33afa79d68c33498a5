HARARE - Murewa-based cultural group, Arts Laboratory Band, made their maiden public performance in Harare last week courtesy of City Sports Bar&rsquo;s weekly event, jam session. Although the Mbende-Jerusarema group led by Rishon Murandu was formed 10 years ago in Murewa, they were struggling to get a promoter. Murandu is credited for pioneering the fusion of electric guitar to traditional Mbende-Jerusarema songs. &ldquo;I was inspired by Botswana cultural musical group Culture Spears who have commercialised their culture through putting it on CDs and videos, hence protecting their heritage. &ldquo;However, ours is a different case in sense that we are operating at a zero budget hence financial challenges are pulling us down, though we are trying hard,&rdquo; Murandu said after giving a remarkable performance. At the Harare joint, the group thrilled fans with their unique sound while displaying energy-sapping dances. Arts Laboratory Band has three studio albums under their belt: Mbende-Jerusarema, Yarira Mhere and Tsika Dzekwedu. &ldquo;It took us three years to record the first album because of financial problems but the response we got from fans was enough to keep us going. &ldquo;It is our wish to have a sponsor or a promoter such that we realise our dream of preserving mbende-jerusarema culture,&rdquo; the-30-year-old-artiste said. The Arts Laboratory Band front man is longing for a chance to share the stage with musicians such as Jah Prayzah and Andy Muridzo who hail from their home area.
