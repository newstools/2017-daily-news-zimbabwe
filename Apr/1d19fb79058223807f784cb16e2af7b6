BULAWAYO - Black Rhinos moved into second place after Cliff Chistamba&rsquo;s second half goal condemned Chicken In n to their second defeat in the Castle Lager Premiership yesterday at Luveve Stadium. Rhinos now have nine points from four match and trail log leaders Ngezi Platinum Stars by a single point. &ldquo;We knew we would score against them but obviously they are a very dangerous team. We closed down their flanks where they are usually reliable with the likes of Passmore Bernard,&rdquo; Chauya Chipembere coach Stix Mutizwa. &ldquo;We also used our numerical advantage well after one of their players was shown a red card.&rdquo; Gamecocks coach Rahman Gumbo was livid with his side&rsquo;s display. &ldquo;I think we didn&rsquo;t come to the party. I think there was a lot of complacency from our side. We relaxed and we were duly punished,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Also we lacked discipline, you look at the cards that we got and subsequently the red card it seems they got frustrated.&rdquo;
