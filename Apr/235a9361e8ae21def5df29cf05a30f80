HARARE - Zimbabwe&#39;s largest platinum producer, Zimplats, says it is in discussions with government over an impending compulsory acquisition of 28 000 hectares of its land by the State. The Alex Mhembere-led platinum mining company yesterday said while government had already made moves to grab the land and use it &ldquo;for the benefit of the public,&rdquo; the group was still engaging the President Robert Mugabe-led administration over the issue. &ldquo;&hellip; The operating subsidiary lodged an objection to the proposed compulsory acquisition. The operating subsidiary is, however, currently engaging the government of Zimbabwe on the matter,&rdquo; Zimplats said in a notice accompanying its results for the quarter to March 2017. In January, government issued &mdash; through a Government Gazette &mdash; a preliminary notice giving fresh notice that it intended to compulsorily acquire the land located within Zimplat&rsquo;s special mining lease area. Ignoring various warnings from market experts that the move will put investment-starved Zimbabwe on a collision course with foreign investors, Mugabe&rsquo;s government repealed all previous notices issued in respect of its proposed compulsory acquisition of the land, unleashing a fresh threat to the miner. This is despite the fact that Zimplats &mdash; majority-owned by South Africa-based Impala Platinum (Implats) &mdash; had filed opposing papers urging the courts to throw the case away on a technicality. Zimplats contends that, under the 2006 release of ground agreement, &ldquo;it was accepted by both the government and Zimplats that the ground that Zimplats remained with was required by Zimplats to achieve its expansion objectives.&rdquo; However, government has completely ignored this, threatening the Australia Stock Exchange-listed company about impending expiry of the miner&rsquo;s 25-year special mining lease granted to its successor BHP Minerals Zimbabwe in 1994. The 28 000 hectares has been lying idle for years and government intends to acquire and re-allocate it to prospective miners who are keen on extracting platinum for the country&rsquo;s economic growth. Market watchers say it is this treatment of a firm that has spent nearly $4,6 billion &mdash; $533 million of this in taxes and royalties &mdash; in the country since 2002 that will spook many investors. Meanwhile, Zimplats realised $21 million from the disposal of $34 million Treasury Bills (TBs) received in settlement of a debt owed by the central bank. Its revenue for the three months decreased six percent to $131,2 million from the previous quarter mainly due to lower 4E metal sales volumes while profit for the quarter after royalties surged 105 percent to $42,2 million. The redevelopment of Zimplat&rsquo;s Bimha Mine remains on schedule to reach full production this month. &ldquo;A total of $32 million had been spent on the project as at March 31, 2017 against an approved total project budget of $92 million. &ldquo;The development of Mupani Mine (replacement mine for Ngwarati and Rukodzi mines) is on schedule targeting to reach the ore contact by May 2020 and full production in August 2025. &ldquo;A total of $8 million had been spent on the project as at March 31, 2017 against an approved total project budget of $264 million,&rdquo; the company said.
