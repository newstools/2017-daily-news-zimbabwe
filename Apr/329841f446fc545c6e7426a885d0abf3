HARARE - The National Paralympic Games got a major boost yesterday when NMB Bank donated medals to the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) for the event. The bank also donated T-shirts for the athletes taking part in the Games which start today until next Tuesday in Bindura. Handing over the medals and T-shirts, NMB chief operating officer Gerald Gore said the bank&rsquo;s decision to support the games was not difficult to make. &ldquo;Not many corporates would jump at the opportunity to support the Paralympic Games as compared to other games,&rdquo; Gore said. The Zimbabwe National Paralympic Games, which are held annually, were introduced in 2008 by the SRC. They provide people living with disabilities with an opportunity to participate in competitive sporting activities and to demonstrate their sporting talents. Speaking after receiving the donation, SRC acting director-general Daniel Kuwengwa thanked all the sponsors and praised the partnerships created through the sponsorship. He said the games created a platform to promote an inclusive society.
