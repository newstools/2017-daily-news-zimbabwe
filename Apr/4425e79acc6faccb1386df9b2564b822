HARARE - Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai&rsquo;s MDC says the chaos and irregularities witnessed in the weekend&rsquo;s Mwenezi East by-election &mdash; which had an unusually high voter turnout despite the warring Zanu PF contesting against little known opponents &mdash; were a bad omen for 2018. The MDC&rsquo;s statement yesterday came in the wake of Zanu PF retaining the seat when its candidate, Joosbi Omar, secured 18 700 votes against the poor showing of candidates from the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA) and the Free Zimbabwe Congress party.
