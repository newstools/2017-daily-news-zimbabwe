MUTARE - At least 265 Mozambican child refugees have missed class during the last term due to staff shortages at Tongogara Primary School (TPS), despite the United Nations offering to pay teachers&rsquo; salaries, a senior government official has said. Tongogara Refugee Camp administrator Meshack Zengeya told Social Welfare minister Prisca Mupfumira during a tour of the facility on Thursday that the school needs an additional 11 teachers. &ldquo;We hope that honourable minister you help in speeding up the process because the money to pay them is there,&rdquo; Zengeya said. TPS head Alec Mlambo said the school has 1 700 children enrolled and would need at least seven early childhood development teachers and four junior grade teachers to admit the 265 children into the school. &ldquo;Considering the recommended teacher-pupil ratio, we will need an additional seven ECD teachers and four for others for us to be able to accommodate the children. &ldquo;We have made a formal request, and out DSI (district school inspector) is aware of this since we sent the request through his officer,&rdquo; Mlambo said. Mupfumira committed to engage the Primary and Secondary Education minister Lazarus Dokora over the issue. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit down with my colleague minister . . . Dokora and discuss this issue. I don&rsquo;t see where the delays could be if the money is there,&rdquo; Mupfumira said. Zengeya also said the refugee children were also failing to pursue their education up to &lsquo;A&rsquo; level due to budget cuts by the UNHCR. &ldquo;UNHCR used to send &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level students to boarding schools but it is now facing financial challenges. For two years now, all children who completed &lsquo;O&rsquo; Level are seated in the refugee camp. They are waiting for an &lsquo;A&rsquo; level school to be established,&rdquo; Zengeya said. He said they are now waiting for the upgrading of St Michael Secondary School in the camp. &ldquo;We are working on meeting certain requirements like an additional administration block, laboratory block and other issues that UNHCR is also helping with,&rdquo; Zengeya said.
