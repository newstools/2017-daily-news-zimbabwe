HARARE - Controversial dancer Beverly &ldquo;Bev&rdquo; Sibanda, who attracted national attention three months ago after she claimed that she was carrying musician Andy Muridzo&rsquo;s baby, says she suffered a miscarriage on Sunday after a performance. Bev&rsquo;s manager, Hapaguti &ldquo;Hapaz&rdquo; Mapimhidze, broke the news via WhatsApp yesterday morning. &ldquo;Allow me to announce that Bev had a miscarriage last Sunday at Holly&rsquo;s Hotel soon after the show tati tikuzivisei sehama dze team Bev (We are informing you as people who work with Bev,&rdquo; reads the post. Mapimhidze added that they the feisty dancer was sought help at Harare Central Hospital after the mishap. &ldquo;She was treated at Harare Central hospital. We have a doctor&rsquo;s report to substantiate it,&rdquo; the controversial dancer&rsquo;s manager said before sending a hospital admission card that was reportedly given to Bev. Efforts to obtain a comment from Sibanda were fruitless as she was not picking up her mobile phone. Muridzo was also not reachable but his manager Gift Petro breathed fire over the purported miscarriage. &ldquo;There is nothing like that. We do not tolerate such nonsense. If she knew&nbsp; that she was carrying Muridzo&rsquo;s baby, why did she failed to inform him about the development? If she doesn&rsquo;t give a satisfactory answer we will take her to court for soiling Muridzo&rsquo;s image,&rdquo; he told the Daily News. Mid last month, Bev claimed that a recent scan revealed that she was carrying a baby boy. &ldquo;Shaa I was told it&rsquo;s a boy. I am experiencing some funny sicknesses, ndiri kungo-feela weak weak so; it&rsquo;s very boring.

When the Daily News sought Muridzo&rsquo;s comment on the claimed baby scan he was unwilling to comment. But in a previous interview with the Daily News, Muridzo said he would not shirk his fatherly responsibilities if the controversial dancer delivered his child. &ldquo;If she is pregnant for sure then it&rsquo;s fine because the child shall be delivered and we will take it up from there,&rdquo; he said. When Bev first shocked the nation with the news at the beginning of the year, the Dherira hit-maker&rsquo;s apologised to his wife and fans while forcefully rebutting the dancer&rsquo;s claims.
