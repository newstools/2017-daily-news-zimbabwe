HARARE - Gospel musician Gift Mahlupeka, who was accused of having an affair with fellow musician Mathias Mhere&rsquo;s wife three years ago, now has a new surname &mdash;Moyo. Mahlupeka told the Daily News that his old surname could have been the cause of the misfortunes that befell him over the past three years. &ldquo;I believe my old surname was cursed and that is why I was wrongly accused of wrecking marriages including that of Mathias Mhere. &ldquo;Mahlupeka in Ndau loosely means suffering person and it is not surprising that it attracted a lot of misfortune for me. For this reason I have decided to drop the cursed name,&rdquo; the upcoming gospel artiste said. He added that his Christian faith motivated the name change. &ldquo;In Christian culture, we believe a good name attracts blessings while a cursed one repels them. The name Mahlupeka is negative and is not in keeping with my Christian beliefs,&rdquo; said Moyo. The Chimanimani-born artiste claims the name change is already bearing fruit.
