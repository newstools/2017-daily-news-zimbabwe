HARARE - The High Court sheriff yesterday evicted 17 people living with disabilities from the Leonard Cheshire Home in Harare&rsquo;s Avenues area. The eviction concluded a two-decade legal battle over occupation of the home, established by the Leonard Cheshire Disability Global Alliance in the 80s. Evicted residents described the expulsion as &ldquo;evil&rdquo;, since they had nowhere to go. In the case between Leornard Cheshire Home Zimbabwe Central Trust and the residents, the High Court in February ruled: &ldquo;The judgment of the court a quo be and is hereby set aside and substituted with the following order as prayed for: the defendants and all persons claiming occupation through them shall vacate the property known as stand 1673 Salisbury Township community known as 85 Baines Avenue Harare.&rdquo;
