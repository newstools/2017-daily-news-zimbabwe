HARARE - Collen Makaza&rsquo;s dream to sign off his career with a Two Oceans Marathon gold medal will have to be shelved for another year after he finished fourth in a hard-fought race in Cape Town, South Africa, yesterday. Makaza was the first Zimbabwean home after stopping the clock in 3 hours 12 minutes and 37 seconds some three minutes behind Lungile Gongqa whose victory became the first time a South African won the men&rsquo;s ultra-marathon since 2012. As for Makaza, he ran long and hard among elite athletes from all over the world to finish two minutes faster than he did last year.
