HARARE - Tremors hit parts of Zimbabwe after an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.5 struck Botswana yesterday. The tremors were felt in Johannesburg and Pretoria in South Africa while frightened residents in Harare ran for dear life after they were caught unaware by the tremors around 1945 hours yesterday evening. The earthquake, which struck around 1940 hours was centred about 229 kilometres northwest of Gaborone. The US Geological Survey (USGS) put the preliminary magnitude of the earthquake at 6.5, while the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) put the magnitude at 6.7. There was no immediate response on any possible damage or casualties from the Seismology Section of the Meteorological Services Department at the time of going to print. In 2016, Zimbabwe recorded a number of tremors with some being felt in Kariba, Karoi, Bulawayo and in Chipinge. This left many convinced the country is no longer an earthquake &ldquo;safe zone&rdquo; with seismic analysts urging government to promptly implement disaster preventive measures. Zimbabwe currently lacks comprehensive disaster risk reduction and preparedness programmes while weak infrastructure not able to withstand quakes has left government less able to keep its population safe.
