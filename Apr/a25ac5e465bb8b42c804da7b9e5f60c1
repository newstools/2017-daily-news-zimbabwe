HARARE - This year&rsquo;s edition of Chibuku Neshamwari Traditional Dance Festival will run from May 5 to July 29 with the grand finale being hosted by Bulawayo on August 5. The Chibuku Neshamwari Traditional Dance Festival, which has been running since 1963, is a tripartite partnership involving the Zimbabwe&nbsp; National Traditional Dance Association, the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe and Delta Beverages. According to an advertisement placed in the media by Delta Beverages yesterday, the winners will pocket $7 000 with position number two winning $5 000 while the third-placed one will take home $3 000. Last year, the competition, held at White City Stadium in Bulawayo, was won by three-time winners of the contest, Redwing Beni Arinoti, from Manicaland. The 18-member Penhalonga-based dance group, which won the same competition in 1996 and 2007, took the first prize of $7 000 with Bulawayo&rsquo;s Sekunjalo MaAfrica pocketing $5 000 after claiming second position. Harare-based Maramuro Agure landed third position and $3 000 in prize money. Last year&rsquo;s national contest was dominated by Nyau, Chimtali and Beni Arinoti dance groups which contributed eight of the 10 contestants. The only exceptions were Bulawayo&rsquo;s Sekunjalo MaAfrica who showcased Umzansi dance and Dzimbabwe T. D from Masvingo who performed Majukwa. Jerusarema Mbende dance, that was proclaimed a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage for Humanity by Unesco in 2005, was conspicuous by its absence at the 2016 Chibuku Neshamwari Traditional Dance Festival finals.
