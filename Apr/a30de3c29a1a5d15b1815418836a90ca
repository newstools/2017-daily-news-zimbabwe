HARARE - Upcoming gospel artiste Plaxedes Meck has collaborated with cleric Onismo Sasa on her latest single called Divine Decorations. The track was released last month. &ldquo;I am inspired by the teachings of ... Sasa, an internationally-acclaimed speaker and also AFM Shiloh Word bishop hence working with him was a humbling experience,&rdquo; the mother of five said. &ldquo;I got inspiration from our church theme of this year &lsquo;Divine Decorations, Commanding Waves of Restorations&rsquo;. The message on the track was derived from ... Sasa&rsquo;s first sermon of the year when he launched the theme.&rdquo; Meck debuted in the showbiz industry with a 10-track-gospel-album Kurangarirwa Nedenga last year. The passion to spread the word of God to all corners of the world keeps Meck going in this tough industry. &ldquo;I am not into music to generate income but it&rsquo;s part of my contribution to the kingdom of God,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was always my wish to preach the word of God through songs as music travels fast as compared to other forms of media and I hope the single will go a long way in fulfilling my desire.&rdquo; Songs making her debut album are Zarurai Meso Angu, Ndovimba naMwari Wangu, Vandiyeuka, Mutsvene, Tachengetwa, Glory, Moyo Munyoro, Mwari Vanokomborera, Mashoko Amai and a bonus track Pamuchinjikwa. She also expressed her gratitude to her husband Daniel Meck for the support. &ldquo;My husband was the backbone of this project and I really thank him for his commitment and support in making my dream come true,&rdquo; she said.
