HARARE - Ailing veteran musician Dickson &ldquo;Cde Chinx&rdquo; Chingaira &mdash; reportedly battling leukaemia &mdash; is getting financial assistance from the Office of the President, a family member revealed. The revolutionary musician was admitted at West End Hospital in Harare nearly a week ago after unknowingly suffering from the ailment for close to three years. &ldquo;Cde Chinx is still in pain. We are just hoping that he will be fine soon,&rdquo; a family member who preferred anonymity told the Daily News, adding that &ldquo;this time, the President&rsquo;s Office is assisting in paying his medical bills&rdquo;. Ever since he contracted the ailment, the Vanhu Vese vemuAfrica hit-maker has not been in a position to fend for his family, with a pro-development social media group Zimbabwe Business and Arts Hub saving the situation by donating food hampers worth close to $500 late last year. A close family member who spoke to the Daily News last week said &ldquo;comrade is not feeling well, vari kurwara (he is sick). He was admitted on Friday&rdquo;. In February this year, he pushed himself to perform at President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s birthday party in Matobo, despite his deteriorating health. &nbsp;
