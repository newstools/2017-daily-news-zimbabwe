HARARE - South Africa-based gospel musician Alpha Nhambure who has since re-branded to Makoti is set to tie the knot on Saturday in Chivhu. Nhambure, 36, a civil engineer by profession will wed Friday Chipare, 41, who is also an electrical engineer in South Africa. The songstress was ecstatic about the development. &ldquo;Generally, there is a misconception in society regarding female artistes; they are considered loose with too much freedom. The fact that I am going into a white wedding makes me very happy as I have managed to prove the society wrong. &ldquo;I challeng fellow female artistes who are still single to get married, this is not only good to them but to the arts sector at large. Society tends to respect and take married people seriously as compared to single ones,&rdquo; the Gutu-bred artiste said. The wedding to be held at Denise&rsquo;s Kitchen comes barely seven months after the songstress released her third studio project Vanotigarira Dare. She features fellow gospel musician Gift Mahlupeka on the song Mufaro Wangu off the latest album. Mufaro Wangu was released as a single track prior to the album to test the waters. Songs making Nhambure&rsquo;s latest album are: Vanotigarira Dare, Zvinoda Munyengetero, Mufaro Wangu ft Mahlupeka, Handina Nyadzi, Kushandira Jesu, I Surrender, Makatendeka and Ndiratidzei Nzira. Nhambure&rsquo;s previous albums are The Alpha (2014) and Muzita Rashe (2015). She specialises on mhande, jiti and sungura beats. Apart from music, the mother of two runs an events management company in the country and is also a poet.&nbsp;
