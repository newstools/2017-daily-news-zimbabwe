HARARE - Hard-pressed President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s government is issuing Treasury Bills (TBs) in a desperate move to raise money to pay restive civil servants&rsquo; 2016 bonuses, Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa told the National Assembly last week. This comes as government buckled under pressure from the agitated public workers, who turned down government&rsquo;s residential stands among other non-monetary offers in lieu of their 13th cheques and threatened to strike, forcing it to add an extra unbudgeted for $180 million to its $4 billion 2017 National Budget. &ldquo;Government&rsquo;s decision to pay the unbudgeted 2016 bonuses after pressure from employee unions is likely to worsen the situation as TBs worth $180 million are expected to be floated in the market to finance these bonus payments,&rdquo; Chinamasa said in a 2017 budget analysis tabled in the National Assembly. He said the move will worsen government&rsquo;s debt situation. Chinamasa said the country was estimated to have about $2,1 billion worth of TBs in the market as at February 28, 2017, issued to bridge the government&rsquo;s funding gap. &ldquo; . . . government decided to clear its contribution arrears to Nssa spanning from June 2013 with TBs worth $180,9 million with tenure of seven years and a coupon rate of 5 percent per annum,&rdquo; he said. Zimbabwe&rsquo;s total external debt was estimated at $11,2 billion, or 79 percent of GDP, at the end of 2016. More than half of it, or $7,5 billion, is in arrears. The cash-squeezed government &ndash; facing a critical funding shortfall to bankroll its commitments, including a bloated civil service wage bill, government workers&rsquo; pension contributions and medical insurance remittances &mdash; has turned to the TBs market, churning out millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of the paper, with economists warning the move is akin to minting fresh cash &mdash; a move that risks fuelling inflation and worsening the liquidity crunch. The bonus deal followed a lengthy deadlock after government was late in paying civil servants, including the army, for several months in a row. Last month, government paid the scandal-plagued State-run pension fund, National Social Security Authority (Nssa), $181 million worth of TBs to clear three-year arrears after failing to remit its contributions to the fund as an employer. Tendai Biti, a former Finance minister credited with overseeing Zimbabwe&rsquo;s impressive economic recovery between 2009 and 2013, said &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in Zanu PF DNA to print money and just spend as if there is no tomorrow&rdquo;. &ldquo;They are printing money owed to civil servants, they have issued $181 million worth of TBs to Nssa, Psmas (Premier Service Medical Aid Society) is also owed, Zesa is owed over $200 million. &ldquo;They have to print TBs amounting to $250 million to pay local authorities in utilities, they have to print to pay NetOne and TelOne $100 million, and they have to print TBs. This is on the back of $800 million that have been issued by Zamco (the Zimbabwe Asset Management Company &mdash; a special purpose vehicle created to take over non-performing loans [NPLs] from banks as a means of cleaning up their balance sheets),&rdquo; Biti said. He said government was also printing TBs to finance help extended to some farmers with inputs under its targeted command agriculture &mdash; spearheaded by Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa &mdash; which aims to ensure the country&rsquo;s food self-sufficiency. &ldquo;They are printing over $500 million in TBs to finance this cantankerous creature called command agriculture,&rdquo; Biti said. &ldquo;If you add these figures, they amount close to $4 billion, almost the national budget. We are back in a new regime of economic insanity. This is Chinamanomics,&rdquo; he said, taking a dig at his successor Chinamasa. &ldquo;Villagers from St Faith (in Rusape where Chinamasa comes from) can&rsquo;t run this economy, it&rsquo;s not possible,&rdquo; Biti said. Early this year, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said government had issued TBs under four categories, long-dated TBs of $549 million issued to banks for the acquisition of non-performing loans by the Zamco; long-dated TBs amounting to $300 million issued for the capitalisation of institutions that include the Reserve Bank, Agribank, IDBZ, ZB, Cottco and CAPS; medium to long-dated TBs amounting to $780 million issued under the Reserve Bank Debt Assumption Act for the central bank debt taken over by government; and short-to-medium-dated TBs amounting to $450 million issued to finance the gap between expenditure and revenue collection by government.
