MUZARABANI - About 300km from Harare into Mashonaland Central Province lies a dry and remote area called Muzarabani where people somehow manage to scratch a living despite both natural and man-made disasters including extreme whether temperatures. The area falls under the natural farming region five which is characterised by high temperatures and low rainfall throughout the year hence indigenous inhabitants have little survival options save for feeding on wild fruits such as mauyu and masawu that can do well under these climatic conditions. Back in the day, communities here used to survive on farming cotton but the majority of them have since relinquished the cotton project due to falling cotton prices on the market which have been exacerbated by the harsh economic situation in the country and stiff competition from cheap imports mainly from China.
