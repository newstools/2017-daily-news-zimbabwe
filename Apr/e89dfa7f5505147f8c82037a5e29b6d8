HARARE - Former&nbsp;Mashonaland Central youth leader, Godfrey Tsenengamu, has sensationally claimed that President Robert Mugabe wants under fire national political commissar Saviour Kasukuwere&nbsp; out of the warring ruling Zanu PF. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Tsenengamu also said Mugabe was using &ldquo;the same methods&rdquo; to deal with Kasukuwere that he allegedly employed to hound his former deputy, Joice Mujuru, out of Zanu PF during the deadly purges of 2014. This comes as Kasukuwere and several other Zanu PF bigwigs are under the cosh in the troubled former liberation movement, following the recent mega demonstrations against them &mdash; in developments which analysts have said bear similar echoes to the political Tsunami of three years ago which buried Mujuru and other party heavyweights. Tsenengamu, who has consistently claimed that he was among the youth leaders who were used by Mugabe to orchestrate Mujuru&rsquo;s downfall, said he had no doubt in his mind that Kasukuwere&rsquo;s Zanu PF political career was &ldquo;hanging by a thread&rdquo;.
