HARARE - The Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) and Spanish top-flight league &mdash; La Liga &mdash; yesterday sealed a landmark deal that could go a long way in opening opportunities for local sport. Antonio Barradas, who is La Liga&rsquo;s representative in Africa, signed the deal with Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa in Harare that will see among other things Zifa benefit through the football exchange programme, grassroots development, train the trainers (instructors). On their part, Zifa will undertake to give mileage to La Liga in all initiatives they are involved in throughout the country. Chiyangwa said the initiative will go a long way in changing the face of the local game adding that Spanish sides could also visit the country as early as July this year. &ldquo;If all goes according to plan we might have Malaga coming to Zimbabwe after their tour of South Africa. We have offered them a very lucrative package that we might take them to Victoria Falls to see one of the seven world&rsquo;s wonder and then fly to Zimbabwe. &ldquo;They will then play at the National Sports Stadium not against the national team but they will play our PSL teams. In other words they will play one of PSL team&rsquo;s or if a decision has to be made they play PSL&rsquo;s best local players. &ldquo;Again it&rsquo;s still under consideration that it might happen in July. Moreso, Antonio will negotiate on behalf of Zifa to send trainers to Zimbabwe.&rdquo; Antonio said La Liga is there to stay in Africa and they would send trainers to the country especially at grassroots level.
