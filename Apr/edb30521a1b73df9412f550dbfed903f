HARARE - ZIFA yesterday said players that have not been registered will not be allowed to play Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches starting this weekend. The association waived the requirement during this past opening weekend of the season as the registration was still in progress. Issuing of player licences and those of the technical teams was delayed by the transition from the manual registration system to an online platform known as Zimbabwe Connect which saw some players being allowed to play without licences on the opening day of the season. Zifa communications and club licensing manager Xolisani Gwesela said: &ldquo;In the opening games of the 2017 Premier Soccer League season, we allowed some teams to play without licences since the licensing process was still in progress. &ldquo;However, players without licences will not be allowed to play in the second round of fixtures because Zifa has issued licences to all registered and eligible players.&rdquo; Coaches are also affected by the new standardisation regulations as only those that have Caf A Licences are allowed to take charge of matches. &ldquo;We also would like to reiterate that no unqualified coaches are allowed to sit on the bench and that Caf A licences are still a prerequisite,&rdquo; Gwesela said. &ldquo;We are very much aware that some clubs have dodged the system by appointing unqualified coaches as team managers.&rdquo; Gwesela added: &ldquo;As Zifa, we take great exception to this dubious distinction, and we urge clubs to be professional. &ldquo;Coaches without requisite badges are also prohibited from entering the field during warm-up. &ldquo;We have also noted with dismay that some clubs are still utilising the services of unqualified medical personnel. &ldquo;Let me explicitly state that only qualified medical doctors and physiotherapists are allowed to sit on the bench.&rdquo;
