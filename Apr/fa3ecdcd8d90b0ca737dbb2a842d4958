HARARE - Harare has failed spectacularly in its attempt to create a world-class city by 2025 due to a widening budget deficit, bankruptcy and bureaucracy, the City&rsquo;s Mayor Bernard Manyenyeni said yesterday. In his second State-of-the-City Address at Town House, Manyenyeni blamed government interference for making the masterplan a fantasy. &ldquo;The turnaround of the city&rsquo;s fortune requires almost 10 years of doing the right things, biting bullets and making tough decisions most certainly in a well-run country. &ldquo;Under current conditions, the city will get worse before it gets better,&rdquo; Manyenyeni said in his 11 000 word speech. &ldquo;In my own mind, I have since decommissioned the 2025 timeline but I have not abandoned the hope and desire for the world-class goal.&rdquo; Amid complaints over the city&rsquo;s non trafficable roads, unaffordable housing, erratic availability of water, Manyenyeni had in his inaugural State-of-the-City Address, last year, shared the hope that his administration could leave council and the City better than they found it. &ldquo; . . .&nbsp; To continue telling stakeholders that Harare will be a world-class city by 2025 is no longer a projection but outright propaganda.&rdquo; Harare City Council (HCC) is currently embroiled in a raging legal dispute over the new town clerk James Mushore &ldquo;who was hounded out of office&rdquo;. &ldquo; . . . a year later, we are caught in legal battles on multiple fronts,&rdquo; Manyenyeni said. &ldquo;Let me reiterate that the position of town clerk of Harare by function and scope is equivalent to the deputy Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet. &ldquo;For Harare the template is for a top professional with global experience and in . . . Mushore we had secured the right person and this aspect is not contested even by those challenging his appointment. Like all of you, I yearn for finality &mdash; but we cannot influence court processes much, in the interim.&rdquo; The appointment of the town clerk caused a major storm at Town House which saw Manyenyeni spend weeks on suspension and two days in police custody. &ldquo;(This came) as two ministers and some arms of the State took turns to sodomise the office, style and person of the Mayor,&rdquo; Manyenyeni said. HCC&rsquo;s main concerns for residents are roads, water and litter. &ldquo;We have very little space to de-couple Harare from both country and the government.&nbsp; We are fully embedded. We are, quite sadly, going to follow the fortunes of the bigger picture,&rdquo; Manyenyeni said. He went on to bemoan that devolution of power remained a pipe dream, insisting &ldquo;almost all our major problems are directly linked to the ministry which should be taking us forward&rdquo;. Manyenyeni bemoaned political interference. &ldquo;We cannot freely employ the best people; we cannot exercise authority over those who we are supposed to lead,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They enjoy unlimited political protection from any of their professional and administrative shortcomings. &ldquo;Devolution has failed &mdash; it is an unwelcome word to those who are supposed to implement it.&nbsp; The only thing that has been devolved so far is the blame.&rdquo; Manyenyeni said the council&rsquo;s salary backlog which stood between three and four months in 2016 has now &ldquo;deteriorated and the current permanent backlog is now around seven months&rdquo;. &ldquo;Efforts to right size our wage packets have met with political and legal headwinds,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The colloquial mantra &lsquo;they do thega&rsquo; is at play and it does not work. If nothing is done about our employment cost by the time we hand over to the next council, the backlog will be a cool 15 months. Manyenyeni said Harare&rsquo;s residents have increased their efforts to litter the city at a time when council&rsquo;s waste collection capacity has declined. &ldquo;We have paid lip service to wetlands: we seem to find non-compliant development dribbling past the system quite often,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;. . . The development of houses on wetlands and the consequences were there for all to see this past rainy season.&rdquo; Manyenyeni said the March 2013 debt write off by Zanu PF hit the city hard. &ldquo;Your council started 2013 on the back of two crippling signatures in March 2013, the ministerial approval of the current salary levels and in July 2013, the debt write-off of $330 million equivalent to more than two years revenue,&rdquo; Manyenyeni said. &ldquo;Not only do we now find ourselves paying nearly $10 million dollars in salaries from a collection of $13 million dollars monthly with seven months&rsquo; arrears, but we are also faced with a ratepayer who is expecting another write-off in 2018.&rdquo; He blasted the Zimbabwe National Roads Authority (Zinara). &ldquo;Motorists pay vehicle licences to Zinara, which money should maintain trafficable roads: the resources and the responsibility cannot be separated,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where the licence fees for Harare vehicles are going to.&rdquo; He shared residents&rsquo; grief and anguish over the excessive number of roadblocks mounted by the Zimbabwe Republic Police within the city. &ldquo;The pain of the roadblocks is widely shared in our communities, and has been exported by visitors to further de-market and derail tourism in the city and in the country.&rdquo;
