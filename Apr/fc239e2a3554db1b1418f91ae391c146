HARARE - Joice Mujuru&rsquo;s National People&rsquo;s Party (NPP) spokesperson Jealousy Mawarire (pictured) resigned yesterday. His resignation &mdash; from NPP spokesperson position and as a card-carrying party member &mdash; comes amid condemnation of his vicious attack and alleged threats to kill Mujuru&rsquo;s spin doctor, Gift Nyandoro. He was reportedly facing disciplinary action over charges of hooliganism motivated by political hatred. &ldquo;I have made this decision after thorough reflection on events happening in the party, especially the unruly behaviour exhibited by your spokesperson . . . Nyandoro, whom you are aware has been showing thuggish behaviour even during National Executive Committee meetings that you chaired wherein he has threatened fellow national members with physical harm or &lsquo;taking them to the satanic realm&rsquo;, whatever that means.&rdquo; Mawarire said in his April 6 letter.
