HARARE - Auditor-General (AG) Mildred Chiri has found that Harare City Council (HCC) did not account for $208 million of public funds in the 2012 financial year. In her 2015 local authorities report tabled in the National Assembly recently, Chiri reported that the majority of councils&rsquo; audited financials were not up to date, with HCC as far behind as 2012. Officials running the council&rsquo;s affairs then are all now out of office and unable to account for the plunder exposed in the latest audit report. Harare&rsquo;s bank balances did not reconcile to the cash book balances, resulting in an unexplained $200 million-plus variance. &ldquo;The financial statements presented by management showed an overdrawn position of $208 430 777 as at 31 December 2012,&rdquo; Chiri said in the report. &ldquo;A bank statement provided by the City of Harare showed an overdrawn position of $7 141 678 as at December 31, 2012,&rdquo; she said, further stating that &ldquo;in addition, the bank confirmed another overdraft of $449 150 as at&nbsp; December 31, 2012 giving a total of $7 590 828.&rdquo; &ldquo;A comparison of the overdrawn position as per management&rsquo;s financial statements and the bank overdraft balances showed a significant variance of $200 839 949.&rdquo; The audit relates to the tenure of former Harare mayor Muchadeyi Masunda who was elected in July 2008 for a five-year term. In response to Chiri&rsquo;s expose, Masunda&rsquo;s successor Bernard Manyenyeni&rsquo;s management claimed reconciliation of the books was currently underway to isolate cashbook postings for payments which were not lodged with the bank. &ldquo;The overdraft relates to creditors purported to have been paid as a result of premature raising of journals prior to the actual payments,&rdquo; the HCC said.
