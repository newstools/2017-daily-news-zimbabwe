HARARE - State-owned financial institution Agricultural Bank of Zimbabwe (Agribank) is negotiating for $48 million in fresh capital with government to recapitalise the business. The bank&rsquo;s chief executive officer &mdash; Sam Malaba &mdash; said the bank, whose core mandate is to fund the country&rsquo;s agriculture sector, was courting strategic partners to raise funds to recapitalise the financial institution. &ldquo;The bank is engaging the shareholder (government) in pursuance of further capitalisation and we are also talking to potential strategic partners. The bank&rsquo;s core capital is standing at about $52 million. We appreciate the continuing support from the shareholder in terms of capitalisation of the bank.&nbsp; Government has recapitalised the bank to the tune of $40 million so far. But for us to fully support the agriculture sector and optimise on business growth prospects, it is important that the bank be further capitalised with a further $48 million,&rdquo; said Malaba. In its financial results for the six months to June&nbsp; this year, which were released this week, Agribank, recorded a marginal one percent&nbsp; increase in net profit to $2,18 from $2,16 million&nbsp; registered in the same period last year. The bank attributed the growth to the re-organisation of the bank, investment in upgrading information communications technology as well as implementation of a wide range of the bank&rsquo;s business growth strategies and initiatives. Malaba said the growth was also due to positive benefits from transferring non-performing loans to Zimbabwe Asset Management Corporation (Zamco). Net interest income increased by 14,2 percent&nbsp; in the period under review to $13 million from $11,42 million recorded in the first half of the previous year. Commission income went up by four percent to $2,3 million during the period under review&nbsp; compared to $2,2 million&nbsp; recorded in the same period in 2016. Total operating expenses surged 5,2 percent to $11,45 million&nbsp; in the first half of this year from $10,88 million recorded in the same period in the previous year. The bank recorded impairment charges of $3,34 million during the period under review from $891 000 recorded in the same period in 2016. Loans and advances declined by 19 percent to $80,28 million during the period under review from $99 million in the same period the previous year, due to transfer of $17 million worth of loans to Zamco that outweighs growth in new loans. Total assets grew by five percent to $214,99 million during the period under review from $204 million recorded in 2016.
