HARARE - The move by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) to increase the current $200m bond notes in the Zimbabwean economy to $500m must be backed by equivalent amounts of US dollars to help defend the value peg, the NKC African Economics think-tank has said. To allay market fears that the introduction of an additional $300m worth of bond notes signals a possible return of the Zimdollar, RBZ governor John Mangudya highlighted that the &ldquo;multi-currency system is here to stay up until the fundamentals of our own currency have been achieved&rdquo;. The governor stated that Harare was currently negotiating with Afreximbank to secure an additional loan to serve as backing for the $300m note issuance. &ldquo;Also, we believe it would be prudent for the RBZ to follow a strategy characterised by a gradual introduction of additional bond notes. &ldquo;This would allow for better control over the money supply while also giving the apex bank the opportunity to monitor the market&rsquo;s reaction and the value of the bond note,&rdquo; NKC analyst Chantelle Matthee said.&nbsp;
