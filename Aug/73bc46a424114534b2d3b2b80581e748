HARARE - FC Platinum will have to beat CAPS United away for the first time in their history if they are to step up their pursuit of the Castle Lager Premiership title this afternoon. The platinum miners travel to the National Sports Stadium this afternoon with history firmly against the Zvishavane-based side. Norman Mapeza&rsquo;s side is currently in fourth place on the log with 39 points from 20 matches and trail leaders Ngezi Platinum Stars by four points. A win by a two-goal margin will propel Pure Platinum Play to second place on the log with 42 points but that will be a huge task. Since their promotion into the top flight league in 2011, FC Platinum have struggled to beat CAPS United. Over the years, Makepekepe have enjoyed better fortunes when the two sides met. The first meeting between the two ended in a thrilling 2-2 draw at the National Sports Stadium in May 2011 with the reverse fixture also ending with a 1-1 draw at Mandava Stadium.
