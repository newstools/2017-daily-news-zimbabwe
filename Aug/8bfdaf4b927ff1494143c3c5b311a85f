HARARE - Jah Prayzah&rsquo;s forthcoming album titled &ldquo;Kutonga Kwaro&rdquo; has been dragged into Zanu PF succession politics by some people pushing for Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa to take over from President Robert Mugabe. Though the album, Jah Prayzah&rsquo;s seventh, will only be released on October 13, some opportunistic Mnangagwa followers have renamed the award-winning artiste&rsquo;s yet-to-be-released project &ldquo;Kutonga Kwaro Garwe&rdquo; in line with the Vice President&rsquo;s nickname. An amended cover of Jah Prayzah&rsquo;s forthcoming album inscribed &ldquo;Kutonga Kwaro Garwe&rdquo; has flooded social media with Higher education minister Jonathan Moyo- who is said to be aligned to the rival G40 faction- posting it on his Twitter page and ominously asking: Is this for real?
