NEW YORK - Donald Trump says he will close down the US government if necessary to build his wall along the Mexico border. The president told supporters at a &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; rally in Phoenix, Arizona, that the opposition Democrats were being &quot;obstructionist&quot;. During the 80-minute speech, he also took aim at the media, blaming them for giving far right groups &quot;a platform&quot;. But he selectively quoted his initial response to violence at a far-right rally that left one woman dead. He omitted the much-criticised claim that &quot;many sides&quot; had to shoulder the blame for violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. President Trump wants Congress to finance his controversial plan to build a &quot;big, beautiful&quot; wall along the United States&#39; border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. But Republicans will need the support of Democrats to secure funding for the wall in a government spending bill, which they are unlikely to get. In his speech, Mr Trump said the Democrats were &quot;putting all of America&#39;s safety at risk&quot; by opposing the wall. He said immigration officers who worked in the area said it was &quot;vital&quot; to stem the flow of illegal immigrants.
