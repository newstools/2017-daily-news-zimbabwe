LUANDA - Angolans are heading to the polls to vote for a successor for their veteran leader. Jose Eduardo dos Santos has been in power in the oil-rich country since 1979, making him the world&#39;s second-longest serving president. He is not contesting this election - Defence Minister Joao Lourenco is standing for the governing MPLA party. His main challenger is expected to be Isias Samakuva, from the MPLA&#39;s rival in the 27-year civil war, Unita. Under Angola&#39;s voting system, people are choosing both the candidate and party in the same election. Analysts says the MPLA, which has been in power since independence from Portugal in 1975, is likely to win. In the previous election, the Casa-CE alliance gained the third most seats. It is led by Abel Chivukuvuku, who split from Unita.
