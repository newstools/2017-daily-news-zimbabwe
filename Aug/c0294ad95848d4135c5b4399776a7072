LAGOS - Nigeria&#39;s President Muhammadu Buhari has led his first cabinet meeting today in five months after receiving medical treatment in the UK for an undisclosed illness. The 74-year-old returned to Nigeria from London last week, but has been working from home following complaints of a rodent infestation in the presidential office. He skipped last week&#39;s ministerial meeting which was cancelled without explanation. Mr Buhari chaired the meeting in &quot;full energy&quot;, presidential spokesman Garba Shehu told the BBC&#39;s Focus on Africa radio programme.
