HARARE &ndash; Zimbabwean rugby coach Liam Middleton, who has coached the sport in various parts of the world, is open to assisting the Sables reclaim their past glory following recent dismal performances. The former Canada 7s coach is currently coaching a local school in between media work and performance consultancy with many neutrals believing that his skills would be priceless for the national rugby team. Zimbabwe is currently reeling in the Rugby Afrique Gold Cup where the side has lost three matches and won only once and on Saturday were humiliated 23-31 by Tunisia at home. &ldquo;Under the right conditions (player welfare) and time available from my employers, I would be open to an approach (from the Zimbabwe Rugby Union),&rdquo; said Middleton of the union which has in the past been guilty of looking after themselves before they look after the players. &ldquo;I have always had a heart for Zim rugby and it is that (love) that drove my involvement and success with Zim rugby for a long period of time. &ldquo;I could take the Sables to the upper end of the Gold Cup log which is the opposite of where they are now, but I&rsquo;d want to see player welfare made a priority by the union.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to see the players presented with the best opportunity to excel.&rdquo; Middleton, who was the union&rsquo;s director of Rugby when the Sables missed out on the 2015 Rugby World Cup qualification by a whisker, felt the technical team was failing to get the best out of the squad. He said that with more objective decisions, the union can still pull the Sables out of the fire. &ldquo;What concerns all those who want to see the team do well is that after last year&#39;s bottom of the log finish there was some change made to the technical team only for it to be reversed,&rdquo; Middleton said.
