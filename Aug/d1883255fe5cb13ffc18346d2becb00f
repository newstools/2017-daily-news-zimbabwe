HARARE - MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai electrified the crowd at the National People&rsquo;s Party (NPP)&rsquo;s inaugural convention held in the capital yesterday, where he belaboured his commitment towards working with former vice president Joice Mujuru in order to unseat President Robert Mugabe. The 65-year-old politician, who had been invited to the convention to give a solidarity message, received a standing ovation when he promised NPP supporters that a coalition with Mujuru would be formed no matter what if the country&rsquo;s deeply-divided opposition parties are to end Mugabe&rsquo;s 37-year rule. Tsvangirai, who is now shaving his head bald after losing his hair to colon cancer, kept his audience captivated by harping on his favourite talking-points that he has used around the country in recent days. He emphasised that there were no differences, politically, or in terms of policy between Mujuru&rsquo;s party, and the MDC. &ldquo;Democracy is a very difficult proposition in Africa but this path you have taken to seek the mandate and legitimacy from the people is the right one. On this day, you have overcome the doubts of many,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was listening to the proposals you make and I see that there is no conflict with our ideals and values, so where is the problem? We can&rsquo;t be divided on the basis of personalities,&rdquo; Tsvangirai said to uproarious applause. He added amid the cheer: &ldquo;If we are agreed on the direction that we need to take, why don&rsquo;t we put our differences aside and be united? We launched the MDC alliance last week and we said we believe in the big tent and that 2018 is the only opportunity that we have as the opposition movement to defeat Mugabe.&rdquo;
