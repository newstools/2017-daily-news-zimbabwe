	HARARE – Fanuel Masukuse, 41, a visually impaired gospel artiste, has written over 136 songs. Sadly for the Renco Mine-based artiste, none of these songs has been recorded yet. 
	“I have been composing songs since 2002. I am sure the songs I have written which can potentially make 17 albums made up of eight songs each will make an impact if I get an opportunity to record. 
	“For this reason I am appealing for assistance to enable me to be a recording artiste. I welcome any form of assistance whether financial or otherwise. I will also be grateful if someone can buy studio time for me,” Masukuse told the Daily News. 
	The visually impaired gospel artiste said he is unable to pay for the recording of his music because he is currently unemployed. 
	“I have no gainful employment at the moment. I mostly spend my time preaching and spreading the Word of God. I am very confident that the message in my songs will go a long way in spreading the Word of God. 
	“I am hopeful that out there is a good samaritan who can help make my dream come true. It is a dream I have had ever since I was in primary school. 
	“At least if I get assistance to record I am sure the quality of my songs will then encourage more people to help me,” said Masukuse.
