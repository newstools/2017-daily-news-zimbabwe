GABORONE - Opposition groups have reportedly come together to form a coalition to challenge President Ian Khama&rsquo;s Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) in 2019 elections. The BDP has been in power since 1966. According to eNCA, four parties - the Botswana National Front, the Botswana Movement for Democracy, the Botswana Congress Party, and the Botswana People&#39;s Party &ndash; came together as &quot;a response to a plea by the people for the opposition to stop splitting votes and work together&quot;. The BDP&#39;s popularity has reportedly been sinking since the 2014 elections due to a &quot;sluggish economic growth and high youth unemployment&quot;, the report said. &quot;With only one opposition party in place now, I believe that the BDP will have to work very hard in the coming years to preserve or better its supremacy at the 2019 elections,&quot; political analyst Anthony Morima was quoted as saying. Khama won a second term in 2014 after his party secured a parliamentary majority at the polls. The BDP garnered at least 29 of the 57 parliamentary seats. The party, however, faced a challenge in urban areas, where opposition parties made inroads since the formation in 2010 of a breakaway party, the Botswana Movement for Democracy (BMD).
