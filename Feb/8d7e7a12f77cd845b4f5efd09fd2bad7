HARARE - For most tobacco users, tobacco cravings or urges to smoke can be powerful. But you&#39;re not at the mercy of these cravings. When an urge to use tobacco strikes, remember that although it may be intense, it will probably pass within five to 10 minutes whether or not you smoke a cigarette or take a dip of chewing tobacco. Each time you resist a tobacco craving, you&#39;re one step closer to stopping tobacco use for good. Most smokers today know that smoking is bad for their health and harmful to people around them. They know they should quit but they also know it&#39;s going to be hard. Fortunately, there&#39;s lots of help available. Smoking tobacco is both a physical addiction and a psychological habit. The nicotine from cigarettes provides a temporary&mdash;and addictive&mdash;high. Eliminating that regular fix of nicotine will cause your body to experience physical withdrawal symptoms and cravings.
