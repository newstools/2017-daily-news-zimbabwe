WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton will never run for office again after losing the US presidential election to Donald Trump in November after the most divisive campaign in memory, a confidante of the Democrat said on Sunday. &quot;I think she&#39;s going to figure out ways to help kids and families,&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a Democratic Party-connected think-tank told CNN. &quot;That&#39;s been what she&#39;s been focused on her whole life, and a lot of issues that are affecting them, over the next couple of years.&quot; &quot;But I don&#39;t expect her to ever run for any elected office again,&quot; she added. Tanden was reacting to a New York Times article speculating about whether Clinton would run for New York mayor against the incumbent Bill de Blasio, her former campaign chief. &quot;I don&#39;t expect her to run for this and I don&#39;t expect her to run for other office,&quot; Tanden said, without giving more specifics about the 69-year-old former secretary of state&#39;s plans. &quot;I think her job is to - what she&#39;s thinking about right now is how to help those kids and families as she has her whole life.&quot; However, Clinton hasn&#39;t completely withdrawn from the public life since her defeat on November 8. She has taken part in two public events and fired off a few tweets. She&#39;s expected at the State Department on Tuesday for the unveiling of an exhibition hall named after her. Her office has also said she would attend Trump&#39;s inauguration on January 20th with her husband, former president Bill Clinton.&nbsp;
