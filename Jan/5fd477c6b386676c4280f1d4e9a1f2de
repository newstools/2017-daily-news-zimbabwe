WASHINGTON - The number of Democratic members of Congress saying they will boycott Donald Trump&#39;s inauguration on Friday has increased to 26. Many have cited as a reason the president-elect&#39;s recent attack on civil rights icon and fellow congressman John Lewis. Mr Trump lashed out at Mr Lewis on Twitter on Friday after Mr Lewis said he was not a &quot;legitimate president&quot;. He said that Mr Lewis was &quot;All talk, talk, talk - no action or results&quot;. Mr Lewis was a prominent member of America&#39;s civil rights movement and is a hero to many Americans. He was among those beaten by police during the infamous Selma-Montgomery voting rights march of 1965. He joined the House of Representatives in 1987 and has served Georgia&#39;s fifth congressional district, which Mr Trump went on to call &quot;crime-infested&quot;, ever since. The president-elect&#39;s insults, made just days ahead of Martin Luther King Day, were the final straw for a number of Democrats who will break with tradition by missing the inauguration ceremony on Friday. &quot;When you insult Rep. John Lewis, you insult America,&quot; said Yvette Clarke, one of five representatives for New York who will boycott the event. There are 535 members of Congress, across both houses.
