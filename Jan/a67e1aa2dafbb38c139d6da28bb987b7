WASHINGTON - Donald Trump has fired the acting US attorney general after she questioned the legality of his immigration ban. Sally Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president&#39;s executive order. A White House statement accused Ms Yates of &quot;betraying&quot; the justice department and being &quot;weak on borders&quot;. Mr Trump replaced her with Dana Boente, US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Mr Boente said he was &quot;honoured to serve President Trump&quot; and immediately directed his department to enforce the controversial order. Mr Trump also replaced the acting director of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Daniel Ragsdale, who has been in the post since 20 January. He is the former deputy director. No reason was given for Mr Ragsdale&#39;s sacking. He has been replaced by, Thomas Homan, the executive associate director of enforcement and removal.
