BANJUL - Officials in Equatorial Guinea refused to comment on Sunday on whether ousted former Gambian leader Yahya Jammeh had arrived in the country. But in a statement, Equatorial Guinea&#39;s opposition denounced the presence of Jammeh, whose 22-year reign was marked by systematic human rights abuses, on their soil. Jammeh slinked off in the dead of night from The Gambia&#39;s capital Banjul in the early hours of Sunday on an unmarked plane alongside Guinea-Conakry&#39;s president Alpha Conde. The strongman&#39;s departure ended six weeks of political turmoil sparked by Jammeh&#39;s refusal to accept his election defeat to new Gambian President Adama Barrow. Following a short stopover in Conakry, the Guinean capital, Jammeh was due to head to Equatorial Guinea, a top Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) military official said. But asked by AFP to confirm this news, Equatorial Guinean authorities did not comment. However, Equatorial Guinea&#39;s Convergence for Social Democracy (CPDS) opposition hit out at the decision to grant Jammeh &quot;political exile&quot;. &quot;The CPDS rejects this decision and holds&quot; President Teodoro Obiang Nguema &quot;responsible&quot; for any consequences Jammeh&#39;s presence on Equatorial Guinean soil could bring, the opposition said in a statement acquired by AFP. The CPDS said other countries had offered to host Jammeh and stressed that Equatorial Guinea has &quot;never welcomed political exiles&quot;. The opposition accused Obiang of showing &quot;contempt&quot; towards the country and &quot;thinking only of his personal gain&quot;. Obiang has been president of Equatorial Guinea since ousting his uncle in 1979. He has been accused of human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, being a dictator and of encouraging a personality cult in the tiny oil-rich nation. Opposition in the country is barely tolerated and the 74-year-old leader was re-elected in April with almost 94% of the vote.
