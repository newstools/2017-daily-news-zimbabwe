PARIS - French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed a radical overhaul of the country&#39;s government. Speaking at the historic Palace of Versailles, he said he planned to cut the number of lawmakers by a third. Doing so would produce a more efficient government and put France on a &quot;radically new path&quot;, said Mr Macron. The French president says he has a broad mandate after sweeping wins in presidential and parliamentary elections this year. If his proposed changes were not passed by parliament within a year, he said he would take the decision to a referendum. In his 90-minute speech, the 39-year-old leader vowed to return a &quot;collective dignity&quot; to France.
