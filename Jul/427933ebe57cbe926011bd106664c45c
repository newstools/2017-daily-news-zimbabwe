HARARE - The Grain Marketing Board (GMB) has been thrown into a quandary, as its general manager Rockie Mutenha faces a lengthy medical layoff &mdash; barely two months after taking control of the strategic parastatal. While board chairman Charles Chikaura has briefly confirmed the ex-Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) boss&rsquo; rush to India for medical attention, questions abound regarding the institution&rsquo;s decision to hire a 60-year-old executive and the implementation of several key programmes such as the maize import-substitution initiative are not in jeopardy without leadership direction or supervision.
