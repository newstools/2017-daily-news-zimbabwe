&nbsp; KAMPALA - Public servants in Uganda are facing a strict dress code after the government issued a circular warning them to &quot;dress decently&quot;. Female staff have been told not to show any cleavage, wear brightly coloured nails, braids or hair extensions, sleeveless or transparent blouses. Men must wear long-sleeved shirts, jackets and ties, while trousers should not be tight-fitting. Staff failing to comply will be disciplined. The guidelines, issued by the Ministry of Public Service apply to all non-uniformed civil servants. But there is a feeling that female staff are the main focus on the new rules. While women will be allowed to wear pant-suits, they have been warned not to wear any tight-fitting clothing. Dresses and skirts must at least be knee-length. Uganda is a conservative society and women have previously complained of being harassed if they wear mini-skirts in public. Female officers - To dress in a skirt or dress that is not above the knees, with a smart long or short sleeved blouse. Officers should avoid wearing sleeveless, transparent blouses and dresses at the work place. - To ensure that the clothing covers up cleavage, navel, knees and back. - Not allowed to have bright coloured hair in form of natural hair, braids and hair extensions. - Maintain well-groomed, neutral polished nails.
