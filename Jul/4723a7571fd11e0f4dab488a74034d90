HARARE - The Zimbabwe Medical Association (Zima) will meet University of Zimbabwe (UZ) authorities to discuss planned medical students&rsquo; tuition fees hikes that have provoked violent protests at campus. Critics say the increase in fees from $700 per semester to $1 500 with effect from 1 August would further disadvantage poor students, who are already under-represented in universities. Zima stepped in after hundreds of medical students &mdash; due to start sitting for exams &mdash; were evicted from halls of residence on Monday evening, forcing some of them to sleep at a local church. A UZ medical student filed an urgent High Court chamber application seeking to bar the institution from evicting students. The court ordered their reinstatement. Zima secretary-general Shingi Bopoto said in a statement: &ldquo;As Zima, we are concerned with the welfare of medical doctors and medical students who are legally allowed to be such in this country.&rdquo; He said their priority was that the students be allowed to continue with their studies while talks were taking place. &ldquo;We will continue dialogue with the students and the UZ administration because for them to make financial adjustments at this time for the five-year programme may not be in the best interest.&rdquo; The UZ was hit by the protests dubbed #FeesMustFall on Twitter. Thousands of students marched through campus heading to vice chancellor Levi Nyagura&rsquo;s office where they wanted to hand a list of demands. Students engaged police in skirmishes as the officers fired teargas. The students waved placards. Some read, &ldquo;#Fees must fall&rdquo; and &ldquo;My mother is a vendor&rdquo;. UZ has said it needed to increase fees to keep up standards. In a memo signed by UZ registrar Sergeant Chevo, the hike had been approved by Nyagura after meeting the student executive council on June 15. &ldquo;It was clearly pointed out that the medical students pay $450 per semester of 15 weeks. &ldquo;In this regard, for third year medical students&rsquo; 30 week semester, they should pay $900. &ldquo;The vice chancellor agreed that the medical students could apply for a payment plan and pay the fees while they attend lectures,&rdquo; the memo read.
