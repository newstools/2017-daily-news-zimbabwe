HARARE - Health minister David Parirenyatwa has said the new Public Health Bill is complete and now awaits submission to Cabinet. This comes amid agitation over supposed delay in the passing of the Bill &mdash; set to replace and amend out-dated health aspects in the 90-year-old Act currently in use. The Bill, among other things, seeks to introduce HIV and Ebola responses as well as management framework for health institutions. In an interview with the Daily News last week, Parirenyatwa said the delay was due to the thoroughness and diligence needed in preparing it. &ldquo;The last Act was written in 1928, so we have to be thorough and look paragraph by paragraph and be able to discern what&nbsp; will be needed for now, which will last a number of years,&rdquo; he said.
