HARARE - A rights group has condemned the use of tear gas by police against ordinary citizens in Harare&rsquo;s Central Business District (CBD) last week and said such action was &ldquo;reckless and dangerous&rdquo;. Dozens were choked when police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at crowds as they tried to disperse protesting vendors, commuter omnibus crew and rank marshals who were protesting against police harassment and use of spikes to control traffic.
