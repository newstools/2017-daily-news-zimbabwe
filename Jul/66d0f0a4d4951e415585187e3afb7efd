HARARE - &ldquo;IT was just a slight hiccup!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza viewed their first Castle Lager Premiership defeat of the season at the hands of Ngezi Platinum Stars on Saturday. Ngezi Platinum Stars gaffer Tonderai Ndiraya&rsquo;s charges got their goals through Donald Teguru and Tatenda Mchisa while former Dynamos midfielder Brett Amidu was on target for FC Platinum but it was not enough to at least earn them something out of the game.
