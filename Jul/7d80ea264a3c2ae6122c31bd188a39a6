HARARE - Egypt giants Zamalek refused to conduct their African Champions League pre-match press conference for today&rsquo;s match against CAPS United due to the presence of a beIN Sports correspondent. Zamalek and fellow Cairo giants Al Ahly last month announced a boycott of the Qatari sports broadcasting network following the rift between Qatar and several Arab countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Egypt and most Arab countries have totally cut out all diplomatic relations with Qatar, which they accuse of supporting extremist groups and destabilising the region. The White Knights&rsquo; president Moratada Mansour said: &ldquo;Zamalek won&rsquo;t permit beIN to broadcast our game against Ahli Tripoli, we won&rsquo;t allow their cameras into the stadium. We hope Al Ahly and Smouha support our decision and take the same action.&rdquo; However, beIN Network, have the rights for broadcasting African Champions League games in Middle East and North Africa, and the broadcaster sent to Harare one of their correspondents to cover today&rsquo;s match between CAPS and the White Knights. Zamalek officials and their technical team were scheduled to speak with the media at the National Sports Stadium yesterday afternoon but immediately declined to proceed with the briefing after noticing the beIN correspondent at the venue. The Confederation of African Football (Caf) match coordinator, who had arranged the press conference failed to convince the White Knights to change their decision. Zamalek are now going to be fined by Caf for refusing to conduct the pre-match press conference.
