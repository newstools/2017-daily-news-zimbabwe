LUSAKA - Zambia&rsquo;s President Edgar Lungu has defended his announcement last night, to move towards declaring a state of emergency, saying he was bringing sanity to the country. He vowed to operate within the constitution. But his political opponents see things very differently. They point to the suspension of opposition MPs, to a media clampdown, and to the arrest of the opposition leader Hakainde Hichilehma, who is now in prison, facing treason charges for a traffic incident involving the President&rsquo;s motorcade. The growing fear is that President Lungu is pushing the nation towards dictatorship &ndash; a charge he rejected today. I know people think I&rsquo;m targeting political players... I&rsquo;m just bringing sanity to our country, so law and order... people&rsquo;s property is not destroyed in [the] manner that we have seen.&quot; The President sought to reassure investors, saying he and his government would stick to the law at all times.
