HARARE - President of the National Council of Zimbabwe Chiefs Fortune Charumbira faces the imminent threat of his luxury SUV vehicle being auctioned off after defaulting on repayments amid a crackdown on overdue loans by banks. People&rsquo;s Own Saving Bank (POSB) has served notice of an auction of the Toyota Land Cruiser for recovering dues from Charumbira. The vehicle is set to go under the hammer on Friday, LM Auctioneers said in a notice yesterday. The senator claimed that the debt was taken up by his brother Mudavanhu Charumbira.
