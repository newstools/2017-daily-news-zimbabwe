HARARE - Businessman and socialite Wicknell Chivayo&rsquo;s marriage to Harare-based Sonja Madzikanda has not been welcomed by some members of his family, it can be revealed. If his sister, Moe&rsquo;s words are anything to go by, there is bad blood between them and the new sister-in-law whose marriage has created the rift in the family. And Moe was not present at her brother&rsquo;s marriage ceremony this past weekend. In several Facebook comments, Moe &mdash; who is based in the United States of America&nbsp; &mdash; lashed out at Chivayo&rsquo;s decision to marry Madzikanda, saying she now &ldquo;resented&rdquo; him. &ldquo;Considering none of his six sisters are attending this circus (the sisters whose names she can&rsquo;t memorise because they are too many) . . . I suggest some of you can go and represent coz pressure yacho ma1 and misquoting people . . . This story is becoming boring, don&rsquo;t you think? &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why less people are showing interest. Hopefully now that they are gonna get married, we can stop hearing daily that they had eaten sadza with what meat,&rdquo; Moe said in one of the posts. In another post she wrote: &ldquo; Hesi mhani KingYaya and QueenWicknell happily ever&nbsp; after till money do them part when the king finds out Queen is a comic book millionaire and owes more than he owns. Good night send us pictures of the $50k that they said he was going to pay, I want to see it.&rdquo; Moe went on to destroy Chivayo&rsquo;s bank cards, which she kept with her in America running her brother&rsquo;s errands It also turns out that Madzikanda has also been bad-mouthing Chivayo&rsquo;s sisters and mother, with Moe blaming Chivayo for telling his new wife about his family. &ldquo;Wicknell should just have left me beefing with his girl. He should have never insulted the whole family on social media over a girl apa he was lying futi. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what made me resent him coz if he can lie like that about his family pane vanhu I wonder what he says behind closed doors, so spare me the lectures I&rsquo;m never saying sorry to anyone. Not to him or his girlfriend, wife or concubine or whatever she is. Case closed,&rdquo; she wrote. Word on the street is that Chivayo paid about $17 000 to the Madzikanda family. In his response, Chivayo said his sister was foolish to think he will ditch his wife because the sister said his wife was scruffy. &ldquo;Listen if she (Moe) doesn&rsquo;t appreciate me, and doesn&rsquo;t respect my choice then it&rsquo;s not my fault, she&rsquo;s my sister, she is my baby, that&rsquo;s my last born, but if she&rsquo;s stupid enough to go on social media and display my business and fight the girl that I&rsquo;m intimate with, that I sleep in the same bed with, that makes me scream all night then she&rsquo;s stupid because she can&rsquo;t win that battle,&rdquo; Chivayo said in a live video on social media recently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because the girl will just come in my bed and say I don&rsquo;t like your sister and I will say for real my sister is foolish. If she says I want you to delete her number, I will delete it, or if I hear you talking to her I will dump you,&rsquo; we are men, we are fools and she&rsquo;s a bully in bed, when you lie in bed you&rsquo;re told this and that and you will say sorry over and over again, we are men, we are weak.
