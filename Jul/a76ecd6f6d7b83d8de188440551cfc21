HARARE - In a&nbsp;desperate bid to overturn a first leg 0-1 defeat suffered at the hands of Namibia in a 2018 Kenya African Nations Championships (Chan) qualifier, Warriors interim coach Sunday Chidzambwa has been forced to tinker with his team ahead of this weekend&rsquo;s decisive return leg. The Warriors, who are bidding for a fifth straight appearance at the Chan tournament, saw their campaign get off to a false start after succumbing to a Hendrik Somaeb second half strike that gave the Brave Warriors an upper hand going into the return leg. Chidzambwa and his charges now hope to salvage their campaign when they host the Brave Warriors at the National Sports Stadium at the weekend to ensure a smooth passage to the final round. And in trying to get the required result, the ZPC Kariba gaffer roped in FC Platinum goalkeeper Petros Mhari to join Black Rhinos&rsquo; Herbert Rusawo and Takabva Mawaya of Ngezi Platinum Stars, who were the only two goalkeepers to travel to Namibia for the first leg. Dynamos defender Obey Mwerahari, who earned a surprise call-up to the team that travelled to Namibia, was dropped while accommodating How Mine&rsquo;s defensive pair of Milton Ncube and Praise Tonha as well as Peter Muduwa from Highlanders and Jameson Mukombwe from Rhinos. In midfield, CAPS United&rsquo;s Moses Muchenje, who started in Namibia had to give way for his teammate Devon Chafa, while Ronald Chitiyo ,who was replaced at the last minute by Denver Mukamba due to his father&rsquo;s illness, is back in the fold.&nbsp;
