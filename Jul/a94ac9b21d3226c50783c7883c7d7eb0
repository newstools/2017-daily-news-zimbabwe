HARARE - After a brief spell of pleasant weather, chilly conditions are expected to return to Zimbabwe this week with light to moderate rains forecast, the Meteorological Services Department (MSD) has said. The MSD&rsquo;s head of public weather services Tich Zinyemba said there is strong likelihood of ground frost in most parts of the country. &ldquo;Unstable atmosphere is expected to culminate in rainy weather conditions across the entire country though little in amounts. &ldquo;Cloudy, cold and rather windy weather should persist in Mashonaland provinces, Harare, Matabeleland North, Manicaland, north of the Midlands and Masvingo provinces. &ldquo;Light rain or drizzle should be expected. It should remain cloudy and cold in most areas,&rdquo; Zinyemba said. He also noted that the light rains would most likely fall today and Friday. The chief forecaster advised in April that the country should brace for an early winter despite the continued rains that were occurring. Zinyemba said windy, sunny and cool conditions would continue throughout the country adding that while during the daytime it may be sunny, the weather will get colder towards the evening. The senior forecaster said it is important that stock up for the cold weather by having warm clothing and blankets. He also warned farmers of both livestock and crop production on the impending cold weather.
