HARARE - High Court Judge Priscillah Chigumba has dismissed an urgent chamber application by Premier Service Medical Aid Society (Psmas) members to have the dissolution of the Psmas board included on the annual general meeting (AGM) agenda. Psmas members Maphios Siamuchembo and Eden Frank Mtambalika were pushing for the dissolution of the board amid accusations of astronomical compensation for top management. The AGM held last week adjourned to allow the courts to make a determination whether the issue should be included on the AGM agenda or not. &ldquo;The judge ruled that the application was not urgent and referred it to the court roll of ordinary cases,&rdquo; advocate Thembinkosi Magwalimba, who was representing the members, said. &ldquo;This means we will have to file heads of argument first, and its completion will not take less than five or six months. &ldquo;The other option would be to appeal against the judgment. It will depend on what my instructor Chiutsi decides.&rdquo; The board for Psmas &mdash; Zimbabwe&rsquo;s largest medical aid society by subscription &mdash; awarded themselves at least $50 000 each in sitting allowances in 2016. The board, chaired by Jeremiah Bvirindi, defended the expenditure saying they had to hold several meeting as they were trying to solve the long-running crisis at the society and had to convene meetings with auditors.
