HARARE - Police have expressed alarm at the spiking murder cases which in some cases, are being fuelled by binge drinking and minor disputes. Police spokesperson Charity Charamba vowed to end the killings that have scaled well over 20 every month. She told the Daily News that close to 20 people were killed in separate murder cases countrywide in the month of June alone, many over what should be normally inconsequential quarrels. &ldquo;As the ZRP, we are noting a trend of murder cases where trivial misunderstandings arise and people end up killing each other for minor disputes. &ldquo;We are calling on the public to exercise restraint whenever they experience disputes with friends, relatives or strangers. &ldquo;No one should take the law into their own hands . . . let us strive to resolve all disputes in a peaceful manner and remember it is only God who can take away human life,&rdquo; said Charamba. &ldquo;The police will continue to conduct awareness campaigns and in the same vein encourage couples and individuals to exercise retrain when faced with disagreements,&rdquo; she added. Charamba said the police was particularly concerned with the increase in beer-fuelled murders. On June 13, a woman and her step mother were involved in a brawl on their way home from a drinking spree, leading to a fight that later saw the woman stabbing her step mother. Meanwhile, police have launched a manhunt for a Chipinge man who allegedly burnt his two children to death and left his third child battling for life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fashion Mupakati, 44, has been on the run since June 30. &ldquo;The accused had a misunderstanding with his wife, sometime in May 2017 and the wife went away leaving the children in the custody of her husband. &ldquo;Then on 30 June around 21:00 hours, Prisca Tom, a female adult in Chipinge, a neighbour to the accused, discovered the accused&rsquo;s house on fire. &ldquo;She rushed to the scene, and then heard a child crying. She alerted other neighbours and they broke in and rescued one of the victims, but they observed that he had deep wounds on the head but had not been burnt. &ldquo;The fire escalated and the neighbours failed to rescue the eight-year-old and the five-year-old,&rdquo; said Charamba.
