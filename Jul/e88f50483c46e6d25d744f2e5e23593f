HARARE - Dynamos forward Denver Mukamba inspired his side to an impressive win over Bantu Rovers last night that sent the Glamour Boys top of the Castle Lager Premiership log. Mukamba provided the assist for the opening goal scored by Lincoln Zvasiya before sealing the win with a wonderful strike from the edge of the box. The result means Dynamos are now on 29 points, one ahead of second-placed Ngezi Platinum Stars, who are in action this afternoon. Dynamos assistant coach Biggie Zuze said: &ldquo;It was a good game. The most important thing for us was to get three points. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that we are now on top of the log. It&rsquo;s good for the guys because they worked hard to be where there are today.&rdquo; Dynamos started strongly but they could not turn their dominance into goals as they at times hurried their efforts. Bantu Rovers looked dangerous on the break though especially each time the current league&rsquo;s top goalscorer Bukhosi Sibanda was in possession. Dynamos&rsquo; inform striker Christian Ntouba, Mukamba and Takunda Sadiki came close in the first half only to be let down by poor finishing while at times they found Bantu goalkeeper Notice Dube equal to the task. The Glamour Boys came back a more determined side in the second half pressing their opponents and were duly rewarded on 51 minutes when Zvasiya rose high to head home a Mukamba corner kick. Cleopas Kapupurika almost doubled DeMbare&rsquo;s lead five minutes later but his effort was cleared off the line by defender Dumisani Ndlovu. Dynamos got their second goal 12 minutes from full time when Mukamba showed composure just outside the box to beat his marker before shooting past Dube. Bantu coach Jospeh Sibindi said: &ldquo;From the way we played, we actually surprised ourselves. We showed that we are no pushovers, we just lost concentration.&rdquo; &nbsp;
