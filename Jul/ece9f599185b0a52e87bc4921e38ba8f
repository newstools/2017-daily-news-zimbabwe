HARARE - Zimbabwe&#39;s financial sector growth is anticipated to slow down to 1,7 percent after bankers smiled all the way to the bank and recorded a 42 percent profit surge last year, data from the World Bank shows. In its recently released economic update, the Bretton Woods Institution pointed out that the country&rsquo;s financial services sector &mdash; which has been growing exponentially in the past two years &mdash; would register a growth slow-down this year on the back of regulatory interventions anticipated to eat into incomes.
