HARARE &ndash; Prominent businessman Shingi Munyeza has urged Zimbabweans to go out in numbers to vote in the key national elections expected mid-2018. In a statement dubbed Advice and Warning from the Watchman released yesterday, just over a year before citizens head to the polling stations to determine the makeup of the next State government, Munyeza &mdash; owner of the upmarket Ocean Basket and News Caf&eacute; restaurants franchises in Zimbabwe &mdash; called on Zimbabweans to make their voice heard. &ldquo;Ours is a constitutional democracy and the only way to change government is through the ballot box &mdash; those eligible to vote must register when registration opens,&rdquo; Munyeza said. &ldquo;Ensure you vote when the time comes&hellip;during this time you will be given all sorts of enticements to vote for certain political parties, please get whatever is on offer but separate the gift from you vote. &ldquo;Always know that your vote is your secret no matter what tricks are used on you blend in your safety and security is threatened.&rdquo; The Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe president chastised urban Zimbabweans for low voter turnout in previous elections at 30 percent compared to rural voter turnout of over 70 percent. &ldquo;Ultimately, its individual candidates that form a government, vote for the individual and not the party,&rdquo; the 50-year-old businessman said. Munyeza said the ruling party (Zanu PF) &ldquo;will never reform itself out of power.&rdquo; &ldquo;So, plan to participate in an uneven electoral system,&rdquo; he said, adding that using social media as a platform to campaign was a futile exercise as &ldquo;10 percent of the voters are not on social media, concentrate on your grassroots structures.&rdquo; The Zimbabwe Head of Christian Denominations vice-chair also had a few words for the ruling party who are set to field the soon to be 94-year-old President Robert Mugabe in the upcoming elections. &ldquo;It is evident that you are entering another election with all the ingredients of &lsquo;bhora musango&rsquo; &mdash; the nightmare of March 2008 can be relieved,&rdquo; he said, referring to the historic 2008 election when a clique of disillusioned Zanu PF members urged the electorate to vote for them only and not Mugabe in what became known as &ldquo;bhora musango&rdquo; (kick the ball off the field). &ldquo;Your worst enemy is not your political opponents but the economy,&rdquo; Munyeza said. Critics accuse Mugabe of wrecking one of Africa&rsquo;s most promising economies through policies such as violent seizures of white-owned commercial farms and disastrous money printing. &ldquo;There are no signs that this is going to be fixed, you will lose against the economy, don&rsquo;t intimidate or command it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Indeed, without your proposed presidential candidate, the party will disintegrate into at least three formations; it&rsquo;s too late for succession fights.&rdquo; Mugabe retains unrivalled support in Zanu PF, which is grappling with factional fights as party officials manoeuvre for advantage in a post-Mugabe era. &ldquo;People are not stupid, therefore avoid making nauseating and abusive statements to the voters, these statements will backfire in due course,&rdquo; he warned.
