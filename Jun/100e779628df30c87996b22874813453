HARARE &ndash; Zimbabwe are hoping to wrap up the three One Day International series against Netherlands with a win in today&rsquo;s second ODI at Amstelveen. Heath Streak&rsquo;s side cruised to a comfortable six-wicket win in the opening ODI on Tuesday and victory in today&rsquo;s match will ensure that they bag the series with a game to spare. That will however, not come on a silver platter as the Associate side is knocking on the door for recognition and the scalp of a Test-playing nation will be a major coup. Zimbabwe pace bowlers were in scintillating form in Tuesday&rsquo;s win with Tendai Chatara with figures of 5-34 runs and Chris Mpofu with 3-30. &ldquo;It feels great taking a fiver and giving the batters a low score to chase down as well as winning the first game hopefully, we will win the next game and take the series,&rdquo; Chatara said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to continue bowling like this and giving the team an opportunity to win games.&rdquo; The locals made early inroads in the Dutch batting line-up reducing them to 40/8 inside 13.5 overs but the last two partnerships proved stubborn as they took the hosts to 142 runs out after 37.5 overs. Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer said the team hopes to build on the momentum and seize the initiative with every opportunity they get. &ldquo;Seamers were exceptional and the batters chased the score down pretty easy and hoping to nail the series tomorrow (today),&rdquo; Cremer told the Daily News from Netherlands. &ldquo;That last partnership was a bit frustrating but guys still bowled well, I think the batters can take some credit for sticking it out but we did have a chat yesterday (Tuesday) and it something we can improve on.&rdquo;
