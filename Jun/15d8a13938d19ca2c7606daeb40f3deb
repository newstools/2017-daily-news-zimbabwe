HARARE - Zimbabwe&#39;s top junior golfers struggled to make an impression during the opening round of the 2017 TOYOTA Junior Golf World Cup in Aichi-Prefecture, Japan yesterday. The side closed bottom of the leaderboard following a combined opening score of 23-over 236, some 29 shots behind leader United States. The US used three subpar rounds to card an opening-round six-under 207 and take a four-stroke lead over host Japan and Thailand (-2) . France sits in fourth at minus-1, one stroke ahead of European counterpart Denmark. As for Zimbabwe, Justin Kersten was the pick of the southern African nation after he carded a five-over 76. Tafadzwa Nyamukondiwa and David Amm found the going tough in a field consisting of 87 of the world&rsquo;s best junior golfers. The pair posted nine-over 80 to take Zimbabwe&rsquo;s tally to 236. Thompson Chimusupai shot a non-counting 83 to close off a miserable outing for Zimbabwe.
