HARARE - The Defence ministry has failed to account for $2 million in the year ended December 2016, the Auditor-General (AG) has said. AG Mildred Chiri carried out the probe of the ministry in line with her fiduciary mandate to investigate all ministries&rsquo; appropriation and finance accounts, revenue statements and fund accounts under the Public Finance Management Act and the Audit Office Act. The main government internal investigations office has released a shocking finances report of the ministry &mdash; responsible for defence and national defence policy. The damning forensic audit report was tabled in the National Assembly on Wednesday. It recommended wide-ranging improvements after the Sydney Sekeramayi-led ministry&rsquo;s Appropriation Account&rsquo;s expenditure did not balance. &ldquo;Total expenditure as per the Appropriation Account amounted to $342 955 984 while the sub-paymasters general&rsquo;s account reflected a total of $315 020 830, resulting in a difference of $27 935 154,&rdquo; Chiri reported. &ldquo;The ministry subsequently accounted for $25 442 568 being salaries and setoffs processed outside the system, leaving a variance of $2 492 586 which could not be reconciled. &ldquo;Therefore, I could not ascertain with accuracy, the actual expenditure figure for the year under review.&rdquo; The swashbuckling AG said the implication was that &ldquo;in the absence of a breakdown of the variance, the expenditure reported cannot be validated as true expenditure for the ministry&rdquo;. The AG, an autonomous government agency, said it found a number of management shortcomings at Defence ministry &mdash; which oversees the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, Zimbabwe National Army and Air Force of Zimbabwe. &ldquo;The ministry should reconcile the expenditure balances from the different sources to enhance accuracy and reliability of its financial statements,&rdquo; the AG said in her recommendation. In its response, the Defence ministry management said the AG&rsquo;s observation is noted. &ldquo;The variance was due to setoffs of $15 068 862 and salaries amounting to $10 373 706 which were processed outside the bank,&rdquo; it said in their response captured in the report. In evaluating the response, Chiri said: &ldquo;The amount of $2 492 586 is still unaccounted for and the ministry should provide the breakdown.&rdquo;
