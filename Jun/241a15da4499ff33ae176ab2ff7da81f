HARARE - American classical musicians &mdash; violinist Sylvia Wehrs and cellist Elizabeth Glorioso &mdash; will perform at Arundel School in Harare on June 17. Wehrs, a Cleveland-based performer and teacher, is a graduate of the Cleveland Institute of Music where she attained a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in violin performance and suzuki pedagogy. She is a fully registered teacher through the Suzuki Association of the Americas and maintains a private studio of students in Cleveland and Zimbabwe with ages ranging from three-year-olds to adults. As an artiste, she performs regularly throughout the Cleveland area with the Akron Symphony, Firelands Symphony, and in chamber and solo appearances in a variety of settings from concert halls to hospitals. Among several topflight events, Wehrs has participated in Bowdoin International Music Festival, National Repertory Orchestra, and Music Inspire Africa, a life-changing programme that allowed her to share her love of performing and teaching music with the people of South Africa and Zimbabwe. Building from this experience, this year Wehrs founded the Cleveland Harare Music Exchange, which seeks to bring musical guidance to the children of Harare through the Suzuki method and high level performances. Wehrs&rsquo; partner on the tour &mdash; Cleveland-based Glorioso &mdash; graduated from the Cleveland Institute of Music&nbsp; (CIM)with a Master&rsquo;s degree in cello performance and suzuki pedagogy in the studio of Sharon Robinson. During her time at CIM, Glorioso participated in the advanced piano trio programme with her ensemble, Trio Zeta, allowing her to take masterclasses with some of the great musicians of our day, including violinist Jaime Laredo and pianist Daniel Shapiro. The rising cellist, who has previously toured Italy and Slovenia with Trio Glorioso &mdash; a piano trio founded in Duino, Italy &mdash; is passionate about teaching children how to become good global citizens and pursue excellence in all areas of life.
