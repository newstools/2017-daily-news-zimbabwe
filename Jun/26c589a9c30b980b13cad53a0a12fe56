HARARE &ndash; First Mutual Holdings (FML)&rsquo;s investment income in the five months to May 2017 surged from $581 000 to $5,5 million, driven by a rebounding Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE), a company official said. The financial services group&rsquo;s chief executive, Douglas Hoto, told shareholders on Wednesday that as a result of the investment income surge, the firm&rsquo;s net income for the five-month period had risen 44 percent to $4,36 million. &ldquo;Investment income rose to an impressive $5,52 million. Of course, this is largely attributed to activity on the ZSE, which has been recording steady gains lately. &ldquo;In fact, it is interesting to note that while it got depressed somewhere along the five months, it is now rebounding. Naturally, this had a positive impact on our investment income,&rdquo; the FML boss said. The local bourse has been steadily gaining in the past few months with equities analysts attributing the bull-run to inflows from foreign investors who hold local stocks on the ZSE and are re-investing as they have been unable to retrieve declared dividend on the back of foreign payment delays. &ldquo;Offshore investors failing to access their dividend can even invest on other platforms&hellip; I am sure you have noticed the ZSE has been on a rebound and this is one of the reasons behind this,&rdquo; equities analyst Ranga Makwata told the businessdaily. On Wednesday, the market rose a further 1,49 percent to close the day at a total market capitalisation of $5,5 billion as the industrial index firmed 1,51 percent to 183,10, buoyed by gains in stalwart counters Delta Beverages, Econet Wireless Zimbabwe and Innscor Africa. However, FML&rsquo;s operating profit for the five-month period dropped 14 percent from $3,2 million prior comparable period to $2,8 million. FML&rsquo;s Gross Premiums Written (GPW) was down two percent to $47,9 million from $49 million prior comparable period on the back of depressed market conditions. In the five-month period, the group&rsquo;s rental income at $2,6 million, was down on prior comparable period from $2,8 million. &ldquo;This was primarily because of downward reviews of rentals. With the depressed economic conditions, tenants have been asking for lease reviews with some moving out, leaving us with voids,&rdquo; Hoto said, adding occupancy had remained flat at around 72 percent throughout the group&rsquo;s property portfolio. Total expenses were lower at $10,9 million from $11 million incurred in the same period last year as the claims ratio fell below 80 percent in the period under review. This comes as the financial services group recorded a 496 percent surge in profit after tax for the six months to June 30, 2016 from $442 000 to $2,6 million, driven by strong performance from the life assurance and health businesses. Some of the group&rsquo;s subsidiaries include listed property firm; Pearl Properties, health insurance unit; First Mutual Health Company Limited, First Mutual Life Assurance Company, FMRE Life and Health, Property insurance unit; Tristar Insurance as well as the Botswana unit, FMRE Property and Casualty Botswana.&nbsp;
