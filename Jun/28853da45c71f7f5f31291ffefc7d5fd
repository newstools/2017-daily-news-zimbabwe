HARARE - The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) has reversed a $3,9 million transaction between African Sun Limited (ASL) and Dawn Properties Limited (DPL) after the two companies flouted listing regulations. This was after ASL and DPL &mdash; both subsidiaries of Brainworks Capital Management (Brainworks) &mdash; had entered into a transaction wherein a facility from a local bank had been secured by fixed property valued at $3,9 million owned by the property arm. The facility was meant to refinance a historical loan that was used in soft refurbishment of hotels owned by DPL. ASL company secretary Venon Musimbe said in so doing the directors had acted with the knowledge that this was within the directors borrowing powers as provided for in the Articles of Association. &ldquo;Furthermore, this assumption was perhaps even more so given the fact that the security of $3,9 million which had been provided by DPL was relatively small with regards to the size of the balance sheet of DPL and all pertinent board processes had been adhered to. &ldquo;Regrettably, regulatory processes were overlooked and specifically the requirements of section 10,2 of the Listings Requirements were not adhered to and the security had to be varied and the transaction with DPL reversed,&rdquo; he said. Section 10,2 of the listing requirements states that if a listed company &mdash; or any of its subsidiaries &mdash; proposes to enter into a related party transaction, the listed company must consult the committee at an early stage.
