MUTARE - Two daring men who hijacked a vehicle carrying fuel impounded by cops and sped off with it have been jailed eight months each. Taurai Masibango, 34, and Rodrick Mapfumo, 26, were convicted and sentenced by magistrate Lazarus Murendo after a full trial. They were given 12-month jail sentences, with four months suspended on condition of good behaviour for the next five years. The duo were being charged with defeating and obstructing the course of justice as defined in section 184 (1) (g) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act. The court heard how on November 22, 2016 three detectives &mdash; detective constable Arnold Chazuza and his colleagues only identified as detective assistant inspector Nzima and detective constable Sakala arrested Ashley Gumira for possession of 60 litres of petrol packed in three 20-litre plastic containers in violation of the Environmental Management Act. Chazuza then took the responsibility of escorting Gumira, who was driving a Toyota Raum, to CID Mutare Central Police Station with the recovered fuel. While on their way and at Mazda Motors, the duo and a third accomplice who is still at large intercepted the Toyota Raum using a Toyota Chaser which was being driven by Mapfumo. When the Raum stopped, Masibango jumped off the Chaser and forcibly opened the Raum&rsquo;s rear door from where he retrieved the petrol and loaded it into the Chaser and sped off. Chazuza still proceeded to the police station with Gumira where he made a report to his superiors for further action. An investigation was instituted leading to the arrest of the duo who was denying the charges. Brighton Shamuyarira prosecuted.
