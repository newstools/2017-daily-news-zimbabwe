The CCZ survey is conducted twice during the first and the last weeks of every month. The total cost of the food basket and the price of each commodity are arrived at by averaging prices gathered from retail outlets throughout the country, the consumer price watchdog said, adding the basket is a fairly accurate depiction of the cost of living in urban Zimbabwe.

The price of milk, washing powder and laundry bar remained unchanged from the end-May figure. &ldquo;As CCZ, we assume that the decrease in prices has been caused by promotions on various commodities in some supermarkets such as the OK Grand Challenge promotion. Supermarkets are competing to entice and attract consumers to buy from them,&rdquo; it said in a commentary. &ldquo;The CCZ continues to encourage consumers to shop conscientiously and to always buy certified products. &ldquo;Where the products are not certified, to exercise their right to information by carefully examining if the products they are purchasing are well labelled, packaged and provided with vital information such as manufacturing and expiry dates and ingredients used in the make-up of the products.&rdquo;
