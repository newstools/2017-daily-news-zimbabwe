HARARE - Zimbabwe took off to a winning start in Netherlands with a comfortable six-wicket win over the Dutch in the first match of the three One Day International series at Amstelveen. The hosts were bundled out for 142 runs from 37.5 overs before the visitors surpassed the target reaching 144 for the loss of four wickets inside 30.2 overs. Sikandar Raza was unbeaten on 31 runs from 36 balls as he took Zimbabwe over the line with a six over the deep midwicket boundary while Ryan Burl was also unbeaten on four runs. A five-for from seamer Tendai Chatara, three wickets by pace bowler Chris Mpofu and Craig Ervine&rsquo;s 44 became the rock on which Zimbabwe&rsquo;s foundation was built on. The hosts&rsquo; captain Peter Borren elected to bat after winning the toss but met a super-charged seamer Chatara, who made inroads in the third over when he had opener Wesley Barresi (4) caught by Ervine. It was not long before the Chatara, Ervine combination came back to haunt the hosts after another opener Stephan Myburgh (14) fell in similar fashion in the fifth over. Soon Chatara would make it three, then four as he grabbed the wickets of Michael Rippon and Reolof van der Merwe both for ducks as Netherlands hung precariously on 28/4 after nine overs.
