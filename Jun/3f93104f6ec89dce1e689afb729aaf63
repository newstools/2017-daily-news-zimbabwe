HARARE &ndash; Zimbabwe&rsquo;s oldest financial institution, Standard Chartered Bank Zimbabwe (StanChart), has spent $6,5 million on a branch refurbishment exercise. The financial services institution&rsquo;s chairman, Lovemore Manatsa, said the bank has already started sprucing up its branches, as part of its optimisation strategy. The strategy aims at reducing excess space by creating lean and cost effective branches with more emphasis on digital touch points. &ldquo;We do not take for granted what a privilege it has been, and continues to be, of growing with you our customers and stakeholders over the 125 years. &ldquo;As we launch a newly refurbished Africa Unity Square branch, it is also important to note that the Bindura, Chiredzi, Kadoma, Marondera, Masvingo and Mutare branches have also been refurbished,&rdquo; he said. Manatsa said the new branches, though a brick and mortar set-up, were committed to the migration to being a fully digital bank. StanChart was the first bank to operate in Zimbabwe 125 years ago. It has a network of 21 branches across the country, many of which are located in major urban centres. It also operates prestige centres as well as 37 automated teller machines.
