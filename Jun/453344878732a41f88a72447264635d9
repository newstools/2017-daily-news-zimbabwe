HARARE - Starting July 5 2017, your favourite daily newspaper &mdash; the Daily News &mdash; will give its readers in Bulawayo and Mutare regions exclusive and comprehensive coverage of news in these respective areas. The Wednesday edition of the Daily News will carry unique and exciting news from Zimbabwe&rsquo;s second largest city and surrounding areas, on top of its usual coverage. Aptly titled Southern News, the section will touch on the socio-economic as well as political goings-on in the City of Kings and other areas of the Matabeleland region. On the other hand, the Eastern News &mdash; appearing every Thursday, starting on July 6 &mdash; will bring you up-to-date news from the eastern border city, undoubtedly one of the country&rsquo;s most strategic urban centres, and its environs. Editor-in-Chief Hama Saburi said there is a lot that is happening in these regions and these stories have to be told to Zimbabwe and the rest of the world. &ldquo;Throughout the country, our readers are thirsty for news on the goings-on within their localities and, as a national newspaper, we have always been looking at how best we could quench our readers&rsquo; appetite for news,&rdquo; said Saburi. &ldquo;While it is our objective to dedicate two or more pages of exclusive content specific to each region, resources do not always permit. But starting from next week, readers in Bulawayo and its hinterland will have more to read on Wednesdays on what would be taking place around them. Also, starting from next week, our readers in the eastern border city of Mutare and the surrounding areas should also expect the same every Thursdays. Do not miss your copy of the Daily News on Wednesday and Thursday every week for the Southern and Eastern News respectively,&rdquo; he added. Saburi said the Daily News would in due course extend this initiative to other regions. &nbsp; &nbsp;
