HARARE - Kwekwe-based&nbsp; gold mine, Gainwell Investments (Gainwell), has lapsed into liquidation due to worsening economic conditions in the country. The miner&rsquo;s liquidator, Modern Mutumwa, told the businessdaily that the company &mdash; which began operations in 2012 &mdash; had been pushed out of business by the country&rsquo;s toughening operating environment, despite firming gold prices and deliberate government policies to promote small-scale gold miners. &ldquo;The small-scale mine&rsquo;s operations failed to take off properly so it is now in liquidation and we are trying to mitigate the situation and salvage something. &ldquo;Yes, the assets will be put up for sale but they will not generate much&hellip; From where I am standing looking at the few assets the company holds, there is very little room for redemption,&rdquo; Mutumwa said. The liquidator attributed the mine&rsquo;s collapse to a &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; operating environment. &ldquo;Honestly speaking, the economy did not help the company&rsquo;s fortunes from high overheads and power issues&hellip;,&rdquo; he said. The miner&rsquo;s creditors met in the capital last week to present proof of claims. &ldquo;&hellip;All creditors who have not lodged their claims are advised to urgently collect proof of claim forms&hellip; The due date for submission of claim forms is Friday,&nbsp; June 23 at the High Court, Master House,&rdquo; the liquidator said. &nbsp;
