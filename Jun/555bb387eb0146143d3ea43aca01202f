BULAWAYO - The Bulawayo City Council and vendors are up in arms with the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) for illegally selling its farm produce in the Central Business District (CBD). Trucks from the ZPCS have been spotted in the CBD loaded with cabbages and other farm produce which was being hawked directly to the shoppers in the late hours.
