HARARE - CAPS United skipper Hardlife Zvirekwi, goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda, defender Dennis Dauda and midfielder Tafadzwa Rusike have all resumed training. The quartet is in contention for the Green Machine&rsquo;s trip to Tunisia to face Al-Ahli Tripoli in the African Champions League on Wednesday. The Green Machine have been ravaged by injuries at a time they are faced by a hectic schedule of fighting on two fronts. CAPS United assistant coach Tostao Kwashi appeared in high spirits yesterday down-playing the injuries and chose to speak on the task at hand. &ldquo;Right, I&rsquo;m sorry I don&rsquo;t want to talk about injuries, I think we have overplayed the issue of injuries. I just want talk about the guys, who will go and fight the battle for the club as well as the country,&rdquo; Kashi said. &ldquo;We have a healthy squad. The onus is on the players to do well and shine whenever they are called to do duty. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about team work, each and every player in our team is very important. All those who are going to be called upon must work hard.&rdquo; CAPS United are coming from a 3-0 morale boosting win over lowly Bantu Rovers on Tuesday and need to beat Tripoli next Wednesday to keep alive their hopes of a place in the knockout stages. In their home game against, the Libyan side, Makepekepe lost 2-4 two weeks ago but Kwashi is not concerned with that result. &ldquo;We are ready for the game. A lot is at stake and every member of the team knows that they have got a role to play. We have been working hard,&rdquo; Kwashi said. &ldquo;We are always positive, we approach the games with a positive mind and we are not under any pressure our hope is that we come out with a good result. &ldquo;We are relaxed and not giving ourselves any pressure.&rdquo;
