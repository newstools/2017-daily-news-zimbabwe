HARARE &ndash; Zora maestro, Leonard &ldquo;Karikoga&rdquo; Zhakata (pictured) takes his act to Mashonaland Central this weekend, performing at Tiringindi Gardens in Mt Darwin on Friday and winding up his weekend programme at Tippaz Bar and Night Club in Shamva on Saturday. Zhakata is currently riding high, buoyed by his success in the 2016 Radio Zimbabwe Coca-Cola Top 50 hit charts in which he made history when three of the songs from his latest album Mutugadzese &mdash;Madam Boss, Zvine Mwaka and Moyo Wekutenda scooped first, second and third prize respectively. Zhakata will use the shows to sample songs from his forthcoming album Mutungadzese Extended. Zhakata&rsquo;s manager, Ben Zhakata said the people should expect top class entertainment as the Zora musicians and his backing group, the Zimbabwe All Stars were in top form. &ldquo;We have seen a steady increase in the level of support from our fans since the beginning of the year, and the shows are a must attend for our Mt Darwin and Shamva fans, who we are encouraging to come and witness the best from Zhakata and the Zimbabwe All Stars Band,&rdquo; said Zhakata.
