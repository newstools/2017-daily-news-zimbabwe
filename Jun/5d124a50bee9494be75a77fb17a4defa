MUTARE - A Penhalonga man has been caged eight months for stabbing his friend over a $231 debt. Alluis Tsiga, 27, of Tsvingwe Township, was convicted after a full trial by magistrate Tendai Mahwe. He was charged with assault as defined in Section 89 of Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23. It was the State&rsquo;s case that Tsiga visited his friend on May 6 at around 2200 hours demanding his money back. The complainant reportedly denied owing Tsiga any money, which infuriated him. In a fit of rage, Tsiga allegedly drew a knife from his pocket and stabbed the complainant on the right side of the stomach. The complainant screamed for help, forcing Tsiga to run away. He then made a police report the next morning, leading to Tsiga&rsquo;s arrest. A medical report confirmed that he sustained a cut on the right side of the stomach which was caused by a sharp object. Brighton Shamuyarira was prosecuting.
