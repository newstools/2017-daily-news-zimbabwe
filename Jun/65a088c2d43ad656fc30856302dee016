HARARE &ndash; Ngezi Platinum Stars held their final training session last night at the National Sports Stadium in order to acclimatise to playing under floodlights ahead of tonight&rsquo;s match against Dynamos. Tonight will be the first time the Castle Lager Premiership second-placed side play under floodlights and they have not left anything to chance. Madamburo need to win today to reclaim first place after Black rhinos walloped Highlanders 3-0 in Harare yesterday. Both teams are now on 26 points after 12 matches but Rhinos have a better goal difference. Ngezi public relations and analysis manager Culvin Mavunga said: &ldquo;We are going to be in Harare tonight (yesterday) because we need to touch base with training under floodlights given that the match will be played in the evening which is slowly becoming a culture the PSL is introducing in the league. &ldquo;This will be our first time to play under these conditions but I don&rsquo;t think we will be affected in any way because you would see that possibly they (Dynamos) are not training in the evening despite playing so much under the cover of lights.&rdquo; The platinum miners were held to a shock home draw by struggling Chapungu before the international break and are aiming to get back to winning ways tonight. &ldquo;We believe football is dynamic, we are doing very well in the league at the moment and they also have been struggling and would want to pick every point on offer to rebuild their campaign,&rdquo; Mavunga said. &ldquo;On our side, we are even hungry to write our own piece of history and determined to win with each and every outing so it is going to be an equally fair contest.&rdquo; Madamburo welcome back lively winger Donald Teguru, who limped off due to injury in the first half against Chapungu while vice captain Edgar Tapera is ruled out of the match. &ldquo;It is a blow but it&rsquo;s something we always expect in football which is why we always have a large pool of players to ensure that we have enough cover,&rdquo; Mavunga said.
