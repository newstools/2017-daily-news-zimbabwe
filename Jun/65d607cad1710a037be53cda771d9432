HARARE - Three bodyguards of Victory World Church founder Paul Sanyangore appeared in court yesterday for allegedly bashing the cleric&rsquo;s brother for exposing the self-styled prophet&rsquo;s allegedly stage-managed miracles. Tatenda Nyika, 23, Prosper Masango, 21, and Prince Kwinjo, 21, appeared before Mbare magistrate Gladys Moyo charged with assault. The trio, which resides in Mbare&rsquo;s Matapi Flats, was released on $30 bail each. The complainant is Andy Zimunya, 31, of Waterfalls in Harare, who is Sanyangore&rsquo;s brother. Prosecutor Lawrence Gangarahwe said: &ldquo;The complainant has been taking Sanyangore&rsquo;s issues to the media and this has not been received well by the preacher&rsquo;s sympathisers who even threatened him at this court. &ldquo;It is common that complainant is on demand by media outlets who want to hear more about Sanyangore&rsquo;s tricks. &ldquo;The courts must be seen protecting its clients &mdash; both accused persons and complainants.&rdquo; Gangarahwe alleged that on June 13 this year, Zimunya was coming from Star FM where he had exposed Sanyangore for stage-managing miracles and prophecies at his church in an interview. As Zimunya was entering his residence, Nyika and his accomplices who had been following him, allegedly began assaulting him. It was alleged that they clobbered him on his ribs and Zimunya sustained internal injuries. Zimunya was medically examined but no medical affidavit was supplied in court.
