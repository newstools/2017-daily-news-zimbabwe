HARARE - Undisputed Zimbabwe men&rsquo;s bodybuilding and fitness champion Simbarashe Mhaka has set his sights on an international accolade as he prepares for next weekend&rsquo;s Nabba/WWF Mr Universe Championships in Brazil. The 29-year-old athlete won the Pretoria Classic in South Africa last month and was awarded a pro card. The Brazilian contest scheduled for Windsor Barra Hotel and Congress in Rio de Janeiro is set to be his first competition as a professional bodybuilder. &ldquo;This show is very important since it will be my first show as a professional bodybuilder and winning it means victory not only for me but my country and Africa as a whole,&rdquo; Mhaka told the Daily News. &ldquo;It is also my wish to bring this federation down to Zimbabwe to help all the aspiring and established bodybuilders who also look forward to participating at the highest level of bodybuilding. &ldquo;Momentarily, I&rsquo;m short of $700 to cater for registration and accommodation but everything else is set and all things being equal I should be leaving on June 20.&rdquo; National Federation of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding and Fitness secretary-general Quite Shangai said his association is fully behind Mhaka&rsquo;s mission despite the athlete going to Brazil under a South African ticket. &ldquo;We take pride in having Simba representing us in Brazil and wish him the very best of success at the contest,&rdquo; Shangai said.
