HARARE &ndash; Chikangwe Tavern in Karoi will host the Mashonaland West Chibuku Neshamwari Traditional Dance Festival contest today. Over 10 traditional dance groups are expected to battle it out for the three prizes on offer. The winner will walk away with $300 with number two pocketing $200. The third group will take home $150. Tsitsa Mwana Gure reigned supreme in the contest last year. Meanwhile, How Mine Chioda won the ticket to represent Matabeleland South at Chibuku Neshamwari Traditional Dance Festival finals to be held in Bulawayo on August 5. Other provincial champions that have already confirmed their participation at the national finals are Goromonzi Arts (Mashonaland East), Chinyakare Traditional Dance Group (Mashonaland Central) and Mufakose- based Culture Warrior (Harare). The winners of the national finals will take home a staggering $7 000 with position number two winning $5 000 while the third-placed one will net $3 000. Last year, Redwing Beni Arinoti from Manicaland &mdash; three-time winners &mdash; won the prestigious contest held at White City Stadium in the City of Kings. The 18-member Penhalonga-based dance group, which won the same competition in 1996 and 2007, took the first prize of $7 000 with Bulawayo&rsquo;s Sekunjalo MaAfrica pocketing $5 000 after claiming second position. Harare-based Maramuro Agure landed third position and $3 000 in prize money. Founded in 1963, Chibuku Neshamwari is sponsored by Delta Beverages through their Chibuku brand and co-ordinated by National Arts Council of Zimbabwe in partnership with Zimbabwe National Traditional Dance Association.
