TRIANGLE &ndash; Triangle blew away Shabanie Mine 3-1 in a four-goal thriller at Gibbo Stadium in a Castle Lager Premiership match yesterday. Guthrie Zhokinyi broke the deadlock in the 58th minute before Courage Denias doubled the lead five minutes later. Denias completed his brace in the 68th minute to secure all three points for the Sugar Sugar Boys while Dylan Chivandire scored a consolation for the visitors on the stroke of fulltime. This was Triangle&rsquo;s only second home win of the season which took them to ninth place on the log with 15 points. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a second victory for us in the six matches we have played at home. We hope to keep winning at home,&rdquo; Triangle coach Taurai Mangwiro said. His opposite Takesure Chiragwi questioned the officiating. &ldquo;Every decision went against us. This won&rsquo;t take our football anywhere. I&rsquo;m happy with the performance of the boys in spite of the difficulties they are facing,&rdquo; Chiragwi said. Meanwhile, FC Platinum&rsquo;s struggles continued when they were held to a goalless draw at Mandava Stadium by lowly Harare City yesterday. This was the platinum miners&rsquo; sixth draw in 11 matches with their last victory coming last month when they beat Chicken Inn away in Bulawayo.
