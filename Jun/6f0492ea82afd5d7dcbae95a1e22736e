HARARE &ndash; Choirs from Arundel and Twin Rivers Schools in conjunction with the Heritage Jazz band will collaborate with dendera star Suluman Chimbetu at Reps Theatre today. Dubbed &ldquo;Salibonani&rdquo; the event that began on Thursday evening and will end tonight, has also featured jazz songstress Prudence Katomeni &ndash;Mbofana, Dance Trust of Zimbabwe and the Repertory Players. Suluman told the Daily News that the collaboration was yet another demonstration of how widely appreciated dendera music has become in the country. &ldquo;I feel very honoured to be afforded this chance to collaborate with the very talented kids from Twin Rivers. It shows that dendera music is now a national treasure,&rdquo; Suluman said. The dendera star added that today&rsquo;s event would present him the chance to pass the baton to the next generation of musicians. &ldquo;The originators of dendera music are long gone but their good works have outlived them. I am particularly delighted to be involved in an event that is perpetuating my late father Simon Chimbetu&rsquo;s legacy,&rdquo; said the Ndomusiya Nani singer. In today&rsquo;s performance, Suluman has promised to deliver up to four songs. &ldquo;We will do Saina and Sean Timba, popularised by music fans as Batai Munhu. I am sure I will get the chance to do two more songs with the kids,&rdquo; the dendera star said. This is not the first time the Twin Rivers Choir has collaborated with an established star. Last year, the school choir teamed up with music legend Oliver &ldquo;Tuku&rdquo; Mtukudzi at a concert hosted by the school to fund raise for the tour of Drakensburg, South Africa. The primary school kids performed Tuku&rsquo;s hits Todii and Neria.
