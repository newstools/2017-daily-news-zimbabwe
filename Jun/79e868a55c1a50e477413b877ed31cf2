HARARE - Zimbabwe International Cricket Umpire Langton Rusere is in England where he is officiating at the Women&rsquo;s ICC World Cup. The 31-year-old umpire, who has been in England since June 15, officiated in yesterday&rsquo;s World Cup warm-up match pitting New Zealand against India at Derby. Rusere is looking forward to getting more assignments during the global competition which gets underway on Saturday. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m super excited but there&rsquo;s a bit of pressure because our team of officials sets the tone of how teams will feel about the umpires. I am obviously thrilled to be taking part in a world cup and I am undoubtedly going to give it my best,&rdquo; Rusere told the Daily News from England. Rusere, who is predominantly a TV umpire and sometimes gets some odd on field duties, made his international debut two years ago during a home series between Zimbabwe and New Zealand and last year he also officiated at the ICC U19 World Cup in Bangladesh. &ldquo;I loved it (experience at the U19 WC). It was my first ICC event and I was nervous to start with, but I formed wonderful working relationships with a lot of the umpires there and it&rsquo;s great being here (England) with a number of them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I learnt a lot about working with different people with different personalities and from various cultural and social backgrounds. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to the experience, obviously conditions are the total opposite of those in Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, so I want to see how I will do under a different set of challenges.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not an easy profession to undertake as most people think they can do a better job, something which Rusere has to contend with. &ldquo;The pressure of being in the TV umpire&rsquo;s seat is that everyone watching on TV deems themselves better than you if you get a decision wrong,&rdquo; Rusere told our sister publication the Daily News on Sunday last year.
