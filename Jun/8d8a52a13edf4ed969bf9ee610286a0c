HARARE - Senetors are seeking what they called a &ldquo;historic&rdquo; increase in Health and Child Care ministry spending, but may run into immediate opposition from frugal Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa who must approve the plan. The proposed rise in the health budget comes as Chinamasa has actually slashed the health budget from $330,7 million last year, to $281,9&nbsp; million this year, which is primarily dedicated to salaries for health sector workers.
