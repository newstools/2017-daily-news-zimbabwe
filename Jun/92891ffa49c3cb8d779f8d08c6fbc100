HARARE - Belgian side Club Brugge yesterday announced they have completed the signing of Zimbabwe international midfielder Marvelous Nakamba, 23, from Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem. The Warriors midfielder will now go through a medical before the deal can be rubber-stamped. &ldquo;Earlier today (yesterday), club has reached an agreement with Vitesse Arnhem as to the immediate transfer of defensive midfielder Marvelous Nakamba,&rdquo; Brugge said in a statement yesterday. &ldquo;A four-year contract awaits the left-footed Zimbabwe international if he passes the medical tests. &ldquo;An energetic midfielder with excellent passing and duelling, Nakamba started his European career with AS Nancy in France in 2012, where Vitesse snatched him away back in 2014.&rdquo; Club Brugge were beaten to the championship by rivals Anderlecht, who were also reportedly to have shown interests in the services of Nakamba alongside other teams like Turkish giants of Fenerbahce and Galatasaray. Nakamba has developed to become one of the Warriors&rsquo; vital players in recent years. He was part of the Kalisto Pasuwa-led Warriors team that qualified for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon and featured in all the three group matches against Algeria, Senegal and Tunisia before there were eventually knocked out. The talented youngster was also part of the squad that thumped Liberia 3-0 at the National Sports Stadium earlier this month in an Afcon qualifier under the guidance of caretaker coach Norman Mapeza.
