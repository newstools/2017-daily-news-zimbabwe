HARARE &ndash; Government is yet to engage 2 300 teachers it wants to complement the new curriculum, Primary and Secondary Education minister Lazarus Dokora has told the National Assembly. Dokora was answering to a question by Maramba Pfungwe Zanu PF legislator Mabel Kaundikiza on government policy with regard to the shortage of agriculture teachers in rural schools. &ldquo;There is the employer who should authorise me to employ,&rdquo; Dokora said. &ldquo;I should have the number of teachers that I require. Since last year, I have been requesting for a specific number of teachers, 7 000 in particular, but there is a government policy that I will be given 2 300 initially. I am waiting for the 2 300 to be released by the employer, the Civil Service Commission. I am still waiting for such a decision to happen.&rdquo; MDC legislator Eric Murai also asked how government would cope with teaching the examinable subject when schools do not have learning materials and other resources. &ldquo;It is true what the honourable member has stated that agriculture has become part of the new curriculum of our nation from Grade 3 onwards. It is also pertinent to note that it is not a case that is universal, that there are no teachers who are able to undertake that task. &ldquo;We have in the past indicated that the deployment of teachers we are making now relates to the specialisation that the teachers did go through during their college days. Further, we have collaboration with the ministry of Agriculture to ensure that there is wholesome and holistic treatment of this area of the new curriculum,&rdquo; Dokora responded. Labour minister Prisca Mupfumira could not be reached for comment as her mobile phones were not being answered.
