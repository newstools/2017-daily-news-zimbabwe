HARARE - &ldquo;An artiste cannot fail; it is a success to be one,&rdquo; this assertion was made by American Sociologist Charles Horton Cooley back in the day; the statement has since lost relevance when applied to Zimbabwean artistes. The harsh economic environment prevailing in the country has left many artistes living from hand to mouth as they struggle even to afford a plate of sadza. The majority of dance groups operating in the country are dancing for peanuts.
