HARARE - A woman busted at Harare International Airport hiding 3,8 kg of cocaine in her luggage was jailed for 10 years yesterday. Harare magistrate Lazini Ncube suspended two years on condition of good behaviour and handed a lenient sentence because she was a first time offender. Drug trafficking has a mandatory 15-year sentence. In mitigation, Beauty Mutashu had pleaded with the court for a non-custodial sentence saying she has nine minors under her care and a mentally-challenged mother. However, prosecutor Fransisca Mukumbiri pushed for a jail term saying drug dealing was on the rise. Mukumbiri said on May 12 this year, detectives from Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Drugs and Narcotics stationed at Harare International Airport were tipped that Mutashu was coming from Brazil aboard a United Arab Emirates flight. The detectives were informed that Mutashu was expected to arrive in Zimbabwe and would be carrying dangerous drugs. When the plane landed, Mutashu proceeded to the Immigration Hall for clearance before tendering her Zimbabwean passport to an Immigration officer. The Immigration officer immediately identified Mutashu and alerted detectives, leading to her arrest. Mutashu was carrying two bags which were searched in her presence. The bags had 11 new shirts each containing a silver rectangle aluminium foil carrying cocaine. The seized cocaine weighed 3,8 kg and had a street value of $304 000.&nbsp;
