HARARE &ndash; Struggling sides Bantu Rovers and Tsholotsho played to a one-all draw during yesterday&rsquo;s Castle Lager Premiership match at Luveve Stadium. The match was evenly balanced and both team played their hearts out to try and avoid anchoring the bottom of the log. Bantu opened the scores 11 minutes into the match through their captain Bukhosi &ldquo;Zaku&rdquo; Sibanda. The Tshintsha Guluva skipper scored from a wonderfully-taken free kick from the edge of the box that gave the visitors&rsquo; goalkeeper Mariyoni Chang no chance. Lucky Nyathi got the equaliser for Tsholotsho three minutes later after Bantu goalkeeper Notice Dube failed to deal with a Dumisani Ndlovu back pass. Nyathi pressed and blocked Dube&rsquo;s clearance with the ricochet going into the empty net. In the second half, the match continued to be concentrated more in the midfield as there were limited scoring opportunities for both teams. Bantu Rovers coach Methembe Ndlovu was content with the draw. &ldquo;I thought it was a game of two halves, we played well in the first half but I think we were out in the second half,&rdquo; Ndlovu said. &ldquo;I thought today it wasn&rsquo;t one of our best games. I can&rsquo;t say we were unlucky to draw, I don&rsquo;t think we did enough in the match.&rdquo; Tsholotsho coach Darlington Dodo said: &ldquo;I think we tried to play. We played not so well the way we wanted to play. We were disturbed by the goal that we conceded very early. &ldquo;We played very good football in the second half, it&rsquo;s unfortunate we created many chances that we could not convert.&rdquo;
