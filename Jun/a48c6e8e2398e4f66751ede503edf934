HARARE - The Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) has commended the Zimbabwe Karate Union (ZKU) for coming up with the initiative to host an international tournament here next month. Apart from promoting the benefits of sport, the 1st So-Kyokushin International Karate Tournament scheduled for Harare on July 22, also stands to benefit the country&rsquo;s economy through foreign currency. &ldquo;The SRC regards the possibility of hosting the So-Kyokushin . . . as a vital opportunity for sport to generate foreign currency earnings into the national economy and also for the country to showcase its sporting talent and organisation acumen,&rdquo; wrote SRC high performance manager Martin Dururu. &ldquo;...SRC appreciates your association&rsquo;s efforts to bring mega sporting events to Zimbabwe as they not only promote the benefits of sport at individual, community and national levels but help generate a positive country image.&rdquo; ZKU spokesperson Grace Chirumanzu said they are expecting about 300 athletes from Malawi, Swaziland, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Brazil, India, Japan and Iran to participate in the tournament scheduled for the Harare International Conference Centre. &ldquo;The athletes are all excited about competing in an international tourney at home as you know most of them hardly participate abroad due to lack of funding,&rdquo; Chirumanzu told the Daily News yesterday. &ldquo;As for the regional and international karatekas, they are aware of the fact that Zimbabwe has produced the first African to win a world title in Sensei Samson Muripo so they are sending their best fighters knowing Africans are just hard nuts to crack. &ldquo;Our fighters need to make use of the remaining weeks on sharpening their technique as well as conditioning the mind for a great show. It&rsquo;s going to be an eye opener.&rdquo;
