BULAWAYO - Chicken Inn moved into third place on the Castle Lager Premiership log following a comfortable 2-0 win over ZPC Kariba yesterday. The Gamecocks are now on 24 points from 12 games and trail log leaders Black Rhinos by only two points. Two goals in each half from Guide Goddard and Innocent Muchaneka was all the home side needed to secure their eighth win of the season. Chicken Inn coach Rahman Gumbo said: &ldquo;I think it was more of a balanced game; it was a game of two halves. First half, I think ZPC were in total control to be frank. But they were a bit hesitant on the way they defended set pieces and they gave us a gift goal. &ldquo;In the second half, we strategised and we defused the situation after throwing in Thabani (Goredema) into the centre of the park to help Guide (Goddard). We were a changed team in the second half and we were in control of the game. We deserved to get at least three or four goals.&rdquo; ZPC coach Sunday Chidzambwa was not happy with the attitude of his players. &ldquo;I thought in the first half we played reasonably well but I think we conceded an easy chance. In the second half, we were not in the game,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Chicken Inn controlled the game and I think the entire second half we were out of the game. I will attribute the loss to the attitude of the players. If we are to win games away from home we have to fight; our guys were not fighting.&rdquo;
