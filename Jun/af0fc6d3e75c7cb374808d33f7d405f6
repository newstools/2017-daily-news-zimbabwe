HARARE - Newboys Mutare Sports Club (MSC) are bracing for gruelling and intensive winter fixtures in the Intercity Rugby League starting with today&rsquo;s encounter against Harare Sports Club in the capital. Unbeaten so far in the league in five matches, MSC coach Mckenzie Munetsi believes the real test begins now in a big-fixture laden month which will see the youthful side from Manicaland playing big hitters Old Georgians, Old Hararians and Mat Warriors of Bulawayo as well. &ldquo;It can only be better, I give it to the youngsters they are doing well and are starting to show some chemistry and maturity,&rdquo; Munesti said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy for them...we are a young team and have come a long way to be where we are and continue to work even harder because we have a goal to reach which is to be a force to reckon with in local rugby circles. &ldquo;The youngsters that are in the forwards and those that are playing in the three quarters have jelled very well, they know what they are supposed to be doing in their positions and we can only just grow.&rdquo; MSC are second on the 11-team log table four points behind leaders Old Georgians, who have 29 points after winning all their six matches. Mutare have won five out of five and have 25 points followed by their hosts today Sportivo, who have lost only once to OGs. &ldquo;We are going to enjoy and learn from the league&rsquo;s big boys my players look up to these guys they are going to play against but have developed a thick skin and have shown that they are no longer intimidated by big names but inspire to match them pound for pound, we look forward to an exciting game,&rdquo; Munetsi said. Today: Mat Warriors v Police Defenders (Hartsfield 3:30pm), Gweru Sports Club v Old Miltonians (Gweru, 3:30pm), Sportivo v Mutare Sports Club (Harare Sports Club, 4pm).
