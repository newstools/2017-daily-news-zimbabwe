HARARE - The Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) has been hauled before the High Court, facing a $13 000 lawsuit after it failed to pay the amount for services offered by a local hospitality firm, Cresta Hotels. According to court papers, the debt dates back to March last year. Cresta Hotels was forced to approach the court on May 17 this year after the ZRU defaulted on the parties&rsquo; agreement to pay for the services rendered. According to the court summons, the hotel claimed when it entered into the hospitality services agreement it was acting at the specific instance and request of the union. &ldquo;The terms of the agreement of service were, inter alia, the following; the plaintiff (Cresta Hotels) would provide hospitality services to the defendant (Rugby Union) at Cresta Lodge, the defendant would make use of the hospitality services as well as the facilities at Cresta Lodge for an agreed cost,&rdquo; Cresta Hotels told the court in its declaration. In terms of the agreement, Cresta Hotels said that the ZRU was supposed to pay for the services rendered upon receiving an invoice from the hotel. The court heard that ZRU failed to fulfil its obligation despite having received the invoices from Cresta Hotels. &ldquo;The plaintiff proceeded to raise the necessary invoices for the services rendered and furnished the defendant with same. &ldquo;The defendant received the invoices and undertook to make the necessary payments but to date the defendant has failed to honour its obligations,&rdquo; Cresta Hotels said. It added, &ldquo;Despite demand, the defendants have neglected, refused or failed to pay the plaintiff the sum of $13 506,50 being the monies due and owing for the hospitality services rendered.&rdquo; The ZRU has not yet fully responded to the claim, but has since filed an appearance to defend, as preparation to fight against the suit. The matter is still pending before the High Court and is yet to be set down for hearing.
