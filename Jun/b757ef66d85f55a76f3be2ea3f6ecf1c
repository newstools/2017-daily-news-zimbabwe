HARARE - Government must release funds to bankroll the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) to ensure a seamless, safe operation imperative to maintain the fluidity of the national rail network, NRZ artisans have said. &ldquo;We do not have safety clothing,&rdquo; Railways Artisans Union (Rau) president Edmore Africa told a news conference on Tuesday. &ldquo;Again if you have not been paid for 17 months and you are working on dangerous equipment, clearly one will not be able to concentrate on his or her job. This scenario is actually dangerous to the workers.&rdquo; This comes as government is seeking $400 million through an open NRZ tender which has attracted over 50 private bidders. &ldquo;We are very elated about the recapitalisation because it has a potential of bringing in much-needed working capital and hopefully our parked salaries will also be unlocked,&rdquo; Africa said.&nbsp;
