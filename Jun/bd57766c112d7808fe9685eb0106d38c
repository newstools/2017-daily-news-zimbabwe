HARARE &ndash; All the attention of Black Rhinos&rsquo; storming start to the 2017 Castle Lager Premiership season has centred on defenders Sydney Linyama and James Mukombwe. Stanford &ldquo;Stix&rdquo; Mutizwa&rsquo;s side were promoted back into the top division this season but have not let that stifle their expansive attacking game. This season, the army side has already beaten former champions Dynamos, Chicken and Highlanders while conceding only four goals from 12 games. However, forward Lot Chiwunga has worked his socks off upfront where he is full of constant running on the shoulders of the last defender. The former Douglas Warriors forward spends the entire 90 minutes harassing and rushing opposition defenders. And when he gets on the score sheet, it is a guarantee the goals are not anything special but all about being a fox in the box.&nbsp; Chiwunga is not a striker for the spectacular but scores the bread and butter goals. The goal he scored in the 1-0 win over DeMbare last month epitomises why Chiwunga is the go-to guy for the army side. The striker closed down the error-prone former Glamour Boys defender Elisha Muroiwa. As Muroiwa tried to find his goalkeeper Tonderai Mateyaunga, Chiwunga pounced on the weak back pass to score the only goal of the game. Last Wednesday, the Black Rhinos player was on target twice in the 3-0 win over Highlanders. Both goals were scrappy finishes from inside the box as Chiwunga punished Bosso for some lethargic defending and poor goalkeeping from Ariel Sibanda. For the first strike, he reacted first to head home from close range when Linyama had risen high to head across goal. Just like the first goal, Chiwunga was the first to get to the ball to toe poke into the net after Sibanda had spilled a shot from Mukombwe. With four goals already this season, the Highfield-born striker attributes his deadly finishing to the work he&rsquo;s doing with assistant coach Maronga &ldquo;The Bomber&rdquo; Nyangela. The legendary former Chauya Chipembere forward was a feared striker in his heyday as he needed only half chances to get on the score sheet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning a lot from coach Maronga. He&rsquo;s teaching me everything he used to do in order to get many goals,&rdquo; Chiwunga said. &ldquo;Last year, I had a long injury lay off and since I got fit, we have been working together to get to my best level.&rdquo; This afternoon, Chauya Chipembere travel to Zvishavane to take on Shabanie Mine hoping to maintain their lead at the top of the log. &ldquo;I would like to thank God because He is the reason why I&rsquo;m scoring goals and I hope I will continue with the same form in the game against Shabanie,&rdquo; Chiwunga said.
