HARARE - The Premier Soccer League (PSL) Disciplinary Committee has awarded Dynamos three points for the abandoned league match against Highlanders at Barbourfields Stadium last month. Bosso were also fined $4 000 and were ordered to pay the costs of the hearing which was conducted at the end of last month. &ldquo;The PSL Disciplinary Committee found Highlanders FC guilty of causing the abandonment of the match. The match has been awarded to Dynamos FC on a 3-0 scoreline,&rdquo; PSL spokesperson Kudzai Bare said in a statement last night. &ldquo;Further, Highlanders FC were fined a sum of $4 000, which together with the costs of the hearing shall be paid by July 31, 2017.&rdquo; The blockbuster clash between Bosso and the Glamour Boys was abandoned in the 42nd minute after the visitors&rsquo; forward Christian Ntouba scored a contentious equaliser. Bosso had taken an early lead through skipper Rahman Kutsanzira. Highlanders fans felt Ntouba was in an offside position and the assistant referee Thomas Kusosa should have raised his flag. The fans threw missiles onto the pitch as they demanded Kusosa to be removed and after a long stoppage it appeared sanity had returned. However, more chaos ensued when the match was about to resume as Bosso fans invaded the pitch. In the end, the match commissioner had no choice but to call the match off. More problems are likely in store for Highlanders as they have also been summoned for another disciplinary hearing following crowd trouble which forced their match against FC Platinum to be called off at Mandava Stadium two weeks ago. Once again, the Bulawayo giants fans threw missiles onto the pitch as they protested the platinum miner&rsquo;s equaliser scored by goalkeeper Petros Mhari following a controversial penalty. Police had to fire teargas to disperse the fans forcing the referee to end the match prematurely in added time.
