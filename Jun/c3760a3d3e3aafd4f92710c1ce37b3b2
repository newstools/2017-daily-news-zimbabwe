HARARE - Government has struck a $100 million deal with banks to rehabilitate the country&rsquo;s damaged roads, Transport minister Jorum Gumbo has said. This comes as rampaging floods, which injured 128 people and displaced at least 1 985, washed away several bridges and roads in major highways in southern parts of Zimbabwe. &ldquo;$14,5 million has been disbursed so far by the Finance ministry,&rdquo; Gumbo told the Daily News on Monday. &ldquo;The second disbursement is expected in the next few weeks once all formalities for mobilising the money from the market are finalised,&rdquo; he said. The funds &mdash; mobilised with the assistance of Zinara and the Treasury &mdash; are set to be channelled to urban and rural district councils, and other road departments. Gumbo said in the meantime, government has been conducting emergency works on the country&rsquo;s roads. He said Manicaland Province&rsquo;s Stapleford and Honde Valley roads&rsquo; washed away sections have been fixed and are now open to traffic. On-going projects include Chikwizi Bridge repairs along Mutare-Masvingo road, which is now 65 percent complete. Repair works at Murare Bridge along Mutare-Masvingo road is now at 80 percent complete.
