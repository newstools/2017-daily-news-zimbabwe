HARARE &ndash; Sunday Chidzambwa has bounced back as Warriors coach after he was named as the side&rsquo;s interim coach for the Castle Lager Cosafa Senior Challenge Cup later this month. Zimbabwe does not have a substantive coach since Kalisto Pasuwa&rsquo;s sacking at the end of February. Chidzambwa, who led the Warriors to their first Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualification in 2004, will take charge of the team for the tournament set to start on June 25. FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza was in charge of the team for last weekend&rsquo;s 2017 Afcon qualifier against Liberia. &ldquo;Zifa advises the local football family that it has appointed...Chidzambwa as the caretaker coach to manage the senior men&rsquo;s team during the Cosafa Cup tournament to be played in South Africa,&rdquo; the association said last night. &ldquo;Chidzambwa, the Vice chairperson of the High Performance Committee (HPC), has been in charge of the Warriors in the past, leading Zimbabwe to her first ever appearance at the Afcon finals in 2004. &ldquo;He will be in charge for this specific campaign in order to reduce his workload, and that of Mapeza, who led the Warriors to a victorious Afcon qualifying run. &ldquo;Mapeza remains the interim coach in charge of the Afcon campaign which got off to a perfect start. Wellington Mpandare continues as the team manager for the Cosafa&nbsp; tournament.&rdquo; Former Warriors coach Moses Chunga, another member of HPTC, has been named as the coach of the Under-17 side while Godfrey Tamirepi and Tafadzwa Mashiri will be in charge of the national Under-23 and Under-15 respectively.
