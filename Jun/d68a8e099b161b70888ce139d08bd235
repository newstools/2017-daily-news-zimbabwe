HARARE - Several&nbsp; Castle Lager Premiership clubs are reportedly interested in the services of Herentals FC forward, Blessing Majarira, who scored on his Warriors debut against Mozambique in South Africa on Monday. The Zifa Northern Region Division One player netted Zimbabwe&rsquo;s fourth goal in the 4-0 win over the Mambas during the ongoing Cosafa Castle Cup at the Moruleng Stadium. Majarira was a surprise selection in interim Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambwa&rsquo;s squad for the tournament and justified his inclusion with a fine finish in added time to put the icing on the score line. Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva admitted the club is now facing a possibility of losing the 28-year-old forward, who has scored nine goals in 16 matches for the second tier league log leaders. &ldquo;For me it was not a surprise seeing him scoring on his debut. I know his ability. He is a focused guy and a top striker so it was not really a surprise for me,&rdquo; Mutiwekuziva told the Daily News. &ldquo;The only challenge that we have now as a club is the possibility of losing him. &ldquo;This could open doors for him to a bigger club but while it will be a huge loss to the team it will, however, be a massive development for the player. &ldquo;And for us we would have played our role in the player&rsquo;s development. So yes, we are very aware of the danger of losing him especially during this period of Cosafa.&rdquo; Already, high-flying Harare giants Dynamos and ZPC Kariba are believed to have shown keen interest in signing Majarira. With the Premier Soccer League mid-season window set to open next month it will be interesting to see the bids that will land on Herentals&rsquo; doorstep for the striker.
