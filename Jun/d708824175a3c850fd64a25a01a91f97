HARARE - Newly-crowned domestic cricket Pro-50 champions Matabeleland Tuskers will receive their trophy after the final game of the season against Mash Eagles at Harare Sports Club today. The Bulawayo-based side wrapped up the championship following their seven-run win over Mountaineers at Mutare Sports Club at the weekend. Tuskers now have an unassailable seven-point lead over second-placed Mid West Rhinos with only one round of matches left in the season. Tuskers amassed a total of 18 points from five matches while Rhinos are second with 11 points, Mountaineers and last season champions Eagles have eight and six points respectively. Despite bagging the title with a game to spare, Tuskers head coach Wayne James said they will not go easy on Mash Eagles today. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long and difficult road to the top given our disappointing performance in the longer version of the game but the guys turned up and fought hard for this recognition, credit to them,&rdquo; James said. &ldquo;It all goes down to lots of hard work, the boys played good cricket all-round throughout . . . and can only be proud of them as a coach. &ldquo;Craig Ervine, Brian Chari, Charles Kunje and Sean Williams have all contributed immensely with the bat and were complemented well by the experienced bowling attack so it was good all-round cricket every department contributed for the good cause.&rdquo;
