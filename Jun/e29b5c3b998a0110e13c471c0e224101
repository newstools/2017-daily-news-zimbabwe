HARARE - Some Harare residents have said they have received bills for thousands of dollars more than they actually owe. Harare City Council director of works Phillip Pfukwa acknowledged that there have been some issues but said they were moving to improve billing accuracy, after years of complaints. &ldquo;We are still doing manual meter reading,&rdquo; Pfukwa said. &ldquo;People can keep their own record of meter reading which they can communicate how much water they are using to mitigate these estimates.&rdquo; Finance director Tendai Kwenda said people in some areas are being charged what is called &ldquo;a capable charge&rdquo; whereby they pay for the potential to have water. Community Water Alliance coordinator Hardlife Mudzingwa called for a water bill audit. &ldquo;The problem is that they use estimates even for customers with functioning meters,&rdquo; Mudzingwa said.
