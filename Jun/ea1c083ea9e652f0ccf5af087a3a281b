HARARE - The Zimbabwe cricket team take on Scotland in the opening match of the two-One Day International series in Edinburgh this morning hoping for a flying start against the Associate side. Captain Graeme Cremer said they have prepared to the best of their ability but will not take the hosts lightly given the fact that they are playing in foreign conditions which suit the home team. &ldquo;We had a good fielding session on Tuesday and a net session at a school in the indoor centre...there was a bit of rain in the afternoon but looks OK today (yesterday),&rdquo; Cremer told the Daily News from Scotland. &ldquo;Today (yesterday) we had another afternoon practice at the Grange where we will be playing our first match where we had a good look at the ground and the pitch.&rdquo; The legspinner-cum-all-rounder said everyone is up for the Scots challenge. &ldquo;Yes everyone is fit and ready to go...we have done a lot of analyses on the Scotland team, from watching their past games and doing video analyses, it will just be about assessing conditions as quick as we can, they know their conditions better than we do, so we will just need to adapt as best as we can,&rdquo; he said. The second and final match is scheduled for Saturday at the same venue. After the short ODI series in Scotland, Zimbabwe will then depart for the Netherlands for three 50 over matches scheduled for June 21, 23 and 25 and from there will proceed to Sri Lanka for a series involving five ODIs and a single Test. Zimbabwe squad: Ryan Burl, Sikandar Raza Butt, Chamunorwa Chibhabha, Graeme Cremer (Captain), Craig Ervine, Hamilton Masakadza, Solomon Mire, Peter Joseph Moor, Christopher Mpofu, Tarisai Musakanda, Richard Ngarava, Donald Tiripano, Malcolm Waller, Sean Williams.
