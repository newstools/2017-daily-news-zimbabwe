HARARE - Acting President Emmerson Mnangagwa has hailed the current Constitution signed into law in 2013, replacing a Lancaster House charter forged in the dying days of British colonial rule. Approved overwhelmingly in a referendum in March of 2013, Mnangagwa said it consolidates the gains of the struggle for independence. &ldquo;Whereas in colonial times, Parliament tended to act unilaterally and enacted laws that favoured the white elite, the new 2013 Constitution consolidates the constitutional gains that our living and late gallant heroes fought for during the struggle for independence,&rdquo; Mnangagwa said during Parliament&rsquo;s Open Day Symposium on Friday. The new Constitution largely retains Zimbabwe&rsquo;s imperial presidential powers, devolves power to local governments, strengthens the role of Parliament, expands civil liberties and elevates the status of women. &ldquo;It is lauded for its substantive content that introduces salient foundational democratic elements that are consistent with the needs and aspirations of the people for a free society,&rdquo; Mnangagwa said. &ldquo;The new Constitution contains an expanded Bill of Rights under Chapter 4 which provides for economic, social, cultural and environmental rights. &ldquo;It has inspired an environment for multi-party democracy to flourish.&rdquo; Meanwhile, legislative watchdog, Veritas has urged National Assembly speaker Jacob Mudenda to issue a statement calling on the Justice ministry to accelerate the alignment of the country&rsquo;s laws to the Constitution.
