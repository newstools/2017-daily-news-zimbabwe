JOHANNESBURG - South Africa&#39;s highest court has ruled that a vote of no-confidence against President Jacob Zuma can be held in secret. The constitutional court said that the Speaker of parliament had the right to order such a move. She had previously stated she did not have the power. Opposition parties believe that under a secret ballot, MPs from Mr Zuma&#39;s ANC party would vote against him. He has survived several previous votes of no-confidence. Mr Zuma has been under constant pressure over everything from corruption allegations to a controversial cabinet reshuffle that saw his widely respected finance minister fired. Delivering his verdict, Chief Justice Mgoeng Mgoeng said that under South Africa&#39;s separation of powers, it was up to the Speaker of parliament to decide how the vote was conducted. The Speaker, Baleka Mbete, is a top ANC official and had argued that the rules of parliament did not allow for a secret ballot. She is yet to say if she will order such a vote. Mr Zuma said the ruling was unfair, telling parliament &quot;you are trying to get a majority you don&#39;t have by saying &#39;secret ballot&#39;&quot;.
