HARARE - Egypt&rsquo;s El Sewedy Electrometers will in the coming months start assembling pre-paid water meters at a contract manufacturer&rsquo;s plant being set up in Harare, a council official has said. Harare deputy mayor Enock Mupamawonde &mdash; who led a delegation of council officials to Egypt to assess the standing of El Sewedy Electrometers &mdash; said it is setting up a plant in Harare soon. &ldquo;Over 250 000 properties need these meters. Once the plant is set in Harare, it will go a long way in transforming our revenue collection, growth and service delivery,&rdquo; Mupamawonde said. He said the Egyptian firm intends on investing $15 million in the manufacture of domestic and commercial pre-paid water meters in Harare.
