HARARE - Experienced sound engineer Mbaki Nleya has set up an institute of sound technology in Harare that will open its doors to its first intake next month. The 31-year-old Nleya, who is currently a tutor at the Zimbabwe College of Music, told the Daily News that his institution called Audio Academy will be the first of its kind in the country. &ldquo;I am a passionate sound engineer and am determined to improve sound production at all levels in the country. That is why I am setting up this institute of sound technology because Zimbabwe needs an institution like this in order to make the transition from analog to digital smooth,&rdquo; Nleya said. The sound engineer added that he has the necessary qualifications to spearhead such an initiative. &ldquo;I set up a sound production initiative at the Zimbabwe College of Music in 2014 after I discovered that the area was lacking in the country. &ldquo;For the past three years, I have also been running some short sound engineering courses across the nation &ldquo;Our lecturers are very qualified. Some of them studied in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom while others are self-taught but have traceable works locally and regionally,&rdquo; he said. To ensure that their courses are in keeping with global trends, Nleya said his institution will be affiliated to a top South African sound academy. &ldquo;We will be affiliated to Emendy Multimedia Technology Institute in Pretoria that offers training in music technology. Locally, we won&rsquo;t be affiliated because other institutions don&rsquo;t have the programmes that we offer,&rdquo; he said.
