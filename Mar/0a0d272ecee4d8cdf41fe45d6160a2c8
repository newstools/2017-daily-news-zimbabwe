HARARE - Logan Cup defending champions Mashonaland Eagles soared over Matabeleland Tuskers with an innings and 85 runs win at Harare Sports Club on Saturday to go top of the log. This is the first time Mash Eagles have assumed top spot on the four-team log standings this season. The home side needed only to bat once and claim 20 wickets inside four days as the visitors struggled to manoeuvre with the bat on the Harare Sports Club wicket. Hosts&rsquo; captain Tino Mutombodzi once again led from the front with the bat with a top score of 86 runs from 158 deliveries. Opener Joylord Gumbie also contributed with a 127-ball 77 as the Eagles reached a total of 379 all out. Tuskers failed to avoid the follow-on after they were bundled out for 103 runs in their first innings and the show never got better following their 191 dismissal in the second innings. Nathan Waller picked a five-for for 29 runs in 10 overs while Taurai Muzarabani 4-31 from 12.3 overs for the Eagles. Tuskers opener Nkosana Moyo top scored for the visitors with 29 runs in their first innings. Eagles&rsquo; seamer Trevor Garwe and left-arm spinner Jalat Khan both picked three wickets apiece in Tuskers&rsquo; second innings. Waller took two wickets while at least there was a half century from the visitors courtesy of opener Brian Chari&rsquo;s 52. Mash Eagles coach Stanley Timoni was delighted with his team&rsquo;s performance which he said was the mark of champions. &ldquo;...It was a top drawer performance from all the departments &mdash; batting once and taking 20 wickets in five sessions is not easy,&rdquo; Timoni said. &ldquo;The boys are physically and mentally fit. At the present moment we are on a good position but we need to win our next two games and make sure we have a bigger gap with the team in second place. Since we are all on the same points.&rdquo;
