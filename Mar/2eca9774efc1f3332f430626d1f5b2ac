HARARE - Afro-fusion artiste Andy Muridzo says his new and third album, Tichambotenderera, set to be officially launched tomorrow at 7 Arts Theatre in Harare will take his brand to new heights. The album is made up of 11 tracks, nine of which, including the title track, were recorded at Tapiwa &ldquo;Maselo&rdquo; Jera&rsquo;s studio while the remainder were recorded at Jah Prayzah&rsquo;s JP Studios. &ldquo;I highly rate this forthcoming album. To me, it surpasses all the previous albums. I have matured with age on this album,&rdquo; Muridzo told the Daily News. The Uzumba-born artiste, who has borne the brunt of social media jokes due to controversial dancer Beverly &ldquo;Bev&rdquo; Sibanda&rsquo;s claim that she is carrying his child, is expecting a good crowd to attend the album launch. &ldquo;Initially, I wanted to unveil the album at a venue in the city centre but I later decided to move the album launch to 7 Arts Theatre because I want to accommodate my growing fan base,&rdquo; the Dherira hit-maker said. It is not surprising that the Chidhafu Dhunda singer has selected Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) Commissioner-General Paradzai Zimondi as his guest of honour. Muridzo and his Jeetaz Band routinely use ZPCS uniforms as stage attire. The Jeetaz Band leader, who has been accused of being a Jah Prayzah soundalike, surprised music fans and critics alike when he was signed up by Military Touch Movement, a music label recently set up by the Watora Mari hit-maker. Muridzo vehemently denies that he is a copycat of Jah Prayzah. &ldquo;The difference between my music and that of Jah Prayzah is that mine is mine and his is his. We only share the genre, but I have never sung what he sings and he never sings what I sing,&rdquo; he recently told the Daily News. Muridzo attracted national prominence thanks to his second album titled Ngarizhambe which spawned sing-along hits like Dherira and Chidhafu Dhunda among others.
