HARARE - Outspoken Manicaland Provincial Affairs minister, Mandiitawepi Chimene &mdash; who could become the latest Zanu PF bigwig today to face a demonstration by her party comrades, for taking on Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa &mdash; says &ldquo;only death can stop me&rdquo; from continuing to defend President Robert Mugabe and his powerful wife Grace. This comes as the ruling party&rsquo;s ugly tribal, factional and succession wars have become even more chaotic and confused, following last week&rsquo;s demonstrations against fellow women&rsquo;s league heavyweights Eunice Sandi Moyo and Sarah Mahoka &mdash; who are under the cosh for allegedly undermining Grace and embezzling party funds, among a litany of other charges. At the same time, Chimene and other members of the ruling party faction going by the moniker Generation 40 (G40) &mdash; who are rabidly opposed to Mnangagwa succeeding Mugabe &mdash; are ratcheting up their claims that the current women&rsquo;s league demonstrations have been hijacked by the VP&rsquo;s allies, Team Lacoste, to sow divisions within the G40 and the party generally. Reacting to today&rsquo;s planned demo against her, the defiant Chimene came out guns blazing yesterday, telling the Daily News that she was not losing sleep over the issue &mdash; claiming further that the mooted march was being orchestrated by Team Lacoste and not Grace, who leads the women&rsquo;s league. &ldquo;Assassinating me will be a better deal than carrying out demonstrations against me. Demonstrations are not a problem to me. The best thing (for her Zanu PF enemies to do to her) is to eliminate me,&rdquo; Chimene said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop them. Ngavaite zvavanoda (let them do what they want). Ndeyekwavo iyo ( it&rsquo;s their problem). Vakatondiita izvozvo vanenge vachitondipa mbiri (if they demonstrate against me they will be elevating me). &ldquo;They definitely won&rsquo;t be damaging me. Kutondiwedzera masimba (they would be making me stronger). In fact, I will be part of those that will be dancing during the demonstrations,&rdquo; the forthright Chimene thundered. This comes as a shadowy State media columnist, Bishop Lazarus, hinted yesterday that the planned demonstration today by the women&rsquo;s league would target Chimene on account of her attacks on Mnangagwa last year.
