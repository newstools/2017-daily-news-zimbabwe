HARARE - Leading female dancers in the country are set to clash at The Volt in Harare this Friday to wind up the women&rsquo;s month in style. The cast includes Zoey Sifelani and Red Angels, Sarah Dee and Real Divas, Wasu and Syndicate Girls, Lady Storm and Swagga Band as well as Beverly Sibanda and her Sexy Angels. Friday&rsquo;s event is being organised by Sarah Dee, real name Sarah Dhliwayo-Nkala. &ldquo;The month of March was set aside to commemorate us as ladies; hence we have decided to close the month in style,&rdquo; she said. March has been declared a month that highlights the contributions of women in history and contemporary society, with March 8 being the International Women&rsquo;s Day. &ldquo;I have selected Zoey, Bev and Wasu because they are my friends; they are hardworkers who have contributed immensely towards the development of the local dance industry. I then went on to pick Lady Storm because I like her rhumba music.&rdquo; Born and bred in Bulawayo&rsquo;s Emganwini area, Sarah Dee is a veteran artiste with a special gift in dancing and singing. &ldquo;I ventured into the showbiz industry in 2007 and have so far released Sokalami, Question Mark, Ndichakuda, Hamusati Maona and Chaputika being the latest project,&rdquo; the mother of four said. &ldquo;Now I am based in Mutare where I am running a modelling agency called Newstars. If all goes well, I am planning to open a dancing school before establishing an art centre.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Lady Storm aka Eriza who crashed into limelight in 2015 thanks to Jah Prayzah&rsquo;s video Eriza in which she features as a school-uniformed girl dancer, is working on her second studio album. &ldquo;The album is almost done, it will comprise eight tracks including my collaborations with Roki, Slizer and Andy Muridzo among others,&rdquo; she said. The 23-year-old former soldier&rsquo;s debut album is called Ndisvikewo. Zoey and Sibanda have only one album each, Totsemukira and Tapinda respectively.
