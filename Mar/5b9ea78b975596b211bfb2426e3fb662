HARARE - In a bid to attract new fans, internationally-acclaimed afrofusion band, Mokoomba has decided not to fix the entry charge to the launch concert of their self-produced third album titled Luyando on tonight at Theatre in the Park in the Harare Gardens. According to Mokoomba manager, Marcus Gora, the decision to &ldquo;liberalise&rdquo; the entry charges is part of their efforts to enable Zimbabweans the chance to &ldquo;enjoy Luyando&rdquo; which has attracted rave reviews in many countries since it was released online by Germany-based Outhere Records on March 10. &ldquo;We want to empower music fans so that they can get the chance enjoy and celebrate our latest album. &ldquo;Music fans can be admitted into the concert by paying any amount they can and want to pay,&rdquo; Gora told the Daily News.
