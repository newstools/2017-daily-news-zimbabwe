HARARE - In a surprising turn of events, the top 50 office bearers of the Zanu PF women&rsquo;s league, who met in Harare yesterday, did not make a definitive public pronouncement on the fate of embattled party heavyweights Eunice Sandi Moyo and Sarah Mahoka &mdash; instead passing the buck on the hot potato issue to the party&rsquo;s politburo. Yet, yesterday&rsquo;s meeting had been called to endorse the decision taken by the women&rsquo;s league&rsquo;s top 10 officials &mdash; who met with powerful First Lady Grace Mugabe in Harare on Monday, and voted for the sacking of Sandi Moyo and Mahoka. Once again, Sandi Moyo and Mahoka, as well as Tabetha Kanengoni-Malinga &mdash; the minister of State in Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko&rsquo;s office &mdash; just like they did on Monday, did not attend yesterday&rsquo;s meeting at Zanu PF&rsquo;s headquarters in the capital. But according to State broadcaster, the ZBC, Grace said the meeting had been convened to consider the petitions that had come from the provinces regarding the two ladies, before &ldquo;making a final decision&rdquo;. &ldquo;Addressing the meeting this afternoon (yesterday), the national secretary of the wing and first lady, Amai Dr Grace Mugabe said the meeting aims at examining the issues raised by the demonstrators and allegations with a view to ascertaining whether they are true, genuine or not and coming up with recommendations that will be forwarded to the politburo and the disciplinary committee for final decision,&rdquo; the ZBC said. Women&rsquo;s league secretary for information Thokozile Mathuthu later told the media after the meeting that the key organ was going to follow its constitution before making public its final decision. &ldquo;Following the deliberations, it suffices at this stage to say that due process regarding the resolution of disciplinary cases of this nature will be followed through the dictates of the rules of our revolutionary party, and the nation will be advised accordingly in the fullness of time,&rdquo; Mathuthu said.
