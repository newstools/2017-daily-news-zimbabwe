HARARE - Comedian Prosper &ldquo;Comic Pastor&rdquo; Ngomashi, who will host the weekly&rdquo; Laugh out Harare&rdquo; gig at Jazz 24/7 tonight, has promised &ldquo;laughs galore.&rdquo; The hilarious jester, who abruptly quit Bus Stop TV last year, will share the stage with Boss Kedha, Probeatz, Mai Titi, Madzitateguru and an upcoming comedian simply called Bothwell. &ldquo;Fans should expect a mix of beats and deliverance from stress. I will tackle a variety of hilarious subjects. It&rsquo;s surely a night not to miss,&rdquo; Comic Pastor told the Daily News. The popular comedian&rsquo;s show tonight follows a recent one-off skit titled New Miracle (Zipit) which he did with Samantha &ldquo;Gonyeti&rdquo; Kureya. The surprise reunion was widely interpreted by many comedy lovers as a precursor to Comic Pastor&rsquo;s return to the popular social media comedy show but the jester ruled out such a possibility. The &ldquo;Laugh Out Harare&rdquo; comedy show&nbsp; &mdash; which takes place every Tuesday &mdash; was officially launched by Jazz 24/7 at the beginning of this month. The inaugural featured Doc Vikela, Simba the Comic King, Gonyeti, Comic Pastor, Boss Kedha and Bhutisi among others. Jazz 24/7 and the City Sports Bar in Harare recently introduced the slot to fill the void created by the closure of the Book Caf&eacute; which shut its doors in 2015. The defunct Book Caf&eacute; and its sister club, Mannenburg, were the only venues in the capital city which featured comedy on a regular basis. Comedy is steadily increasing its support base in the country. Last year, Ugandan comedian Anne Kansiime held two sold-out shows on two consecutive days at the 7 Arts Theatre (twice) and Harare International Conference Centre-a feat which had proved a mammoth one to many local artistes including high -profile musicians.
