HARARE - Three generations of Peter Haritatos&rsquo; family have owned bakeries amid the rocky outcrops jutting up at the centre of the Kadoma mining area, which provides gold, copper and nickel here. He is popular in town, and speaks fluent Shona. Haritatos is just one of the locals, he even has a Shona nickname &mdash; Baba George, meaning &ldquo;George&rsquo;s dad.&rdquo; But he is pliant. And in Zimbabwe, where President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s ruling Zanu PF party and an army of war veterans have violently driven white farmers away in a chaotic land reform programme, Haritatos &mdash; who is the Zanu PF MP for Muzvezve &mdash; has not been a target. In the past 14 years, more than 4 000 white-owned farms have been occupied, a dozen white farmers have been killed, and some 20 others have died in the violence. Against this backdrop of fear and retaliation, Haritatos took a stand in a dramatic denial last week, rejecting his race. &ldquo;I am not white, I am Greek,&rdquo; declared Haritatos. This made top Zanu PF officials at a Mhondoro-Ngezi gathering last week extremely happy.
