HARARE - Highly-energetic singer and actress Kessia Masona, who plays the lead role in television drama Muchaneta, is returning to City Sports Bar&rsquo;s weekly event Jam Session tonight. She is expected to share the stage with Tendai Chimombe, Allan Chimbetu, Tendai Dembo, Lady Storm, Juntal, Malax, Chief Hwenje Shumba, Were, Tendai Manatsa, Liversy Matamba, Talking Guitars, Biggie and Eriya Tembo. Masona previously featured at the weekly event in October last year where she performed for only 15 minutes but it was enough to convince her fans that she was equal to the task. &ldquo;I have been in the industry for the past 17 years but fame only came last year thanks to Muchaneta. &ldquo;I was expecting a breakthrough to come from music but God has other plans for me. Now my music career is flourishing because of the popularity of Muchaneta. &ldquo;Last year, I was invited to grace a number of events in Mozambique owing to the popularity of Muchaneta,&rdquo; the Marondera-bred artiste said. The mother of two told the Daily News that she does not take drugs. &ldquo;I am a Christian but currently I do not belong to any church though I have the gift to heal through prayer, not really like a prophetess, but I just have a gift of praying for people with sickness, those who are barren among others. It&rsquo;s either I dream of someone&rsquo;s problem or I feel it in my body,&rdquo; she said. Masona, who is currently studying towards a Bachelor of Science degree in Community Development with the Women&rsquo;s University in Africa, has a single 10-track album called Gumbomutsvairo that was produced by Munyaradzi Viyali.
