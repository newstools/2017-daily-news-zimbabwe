HARARE - As expected, powerful First Lady Grace Mugabe and her influential Zanu PF women&rsquo;s league yesterday sacked embattled party heavyweights Eunice Sandi Moyo and Sarah Mahoka from within their ranks &mdash; meaning that it may be a matter of time before the two are in turn jettisoned altogether from President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s warring former liberation movement. The move &mdash; which is likely to further fuel Zanu PF&rsquo;s deadly tribal, factional and succession brawls &mdash; prompted a stunned sympathiser of the two ladies to tell the Daily News last night that &ldquo;musha waparara&rdquo;, which loosely translated means the party is finished. Other well-placed sources said after a marathon, all-day meeting of the women&rsquo;s league&rsquo;s top 10 office bearers, Sandi Moyo and the vocal Mahoka had been summarily booted out of the key organ, amid further reports that discussions leading to the decision had been both &ldquo;heavy and heated&rdquo;. Curiously, both Sandi Moyo and Mahoka, as well as Tabetha Kanengoni-Malinga, the minister of State in Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko&rsquo;s office, did not attend the meeting even though all of them are part of the league&rsquo;s top 10. While the league itself was tight-lipped about what had transpired, the sources said an official announcement about the expulsions would be made today &mdash; when the rest of the women&rsquo;s league&rsquo;s executives, including provincial leaders, are expected to congregate in Harare. &ldquo;They (Sandi Moyo and Mahoka) have been expelled. Amai (Grace) showed her power today and from now on they are nobodies &ldquo;Amai will chair a meeting of the women&rsquo;s league top 50 at the Zanu PF Headquarters on Tuesday, and we understand that both Sandi and Mahoka are barred from attending that meeting,&rdquo; one of the sources who spoke to the Daily News said.
