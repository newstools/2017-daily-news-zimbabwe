HARARE - Retailers and dealers fuelling the three-tier pricing that has emerged as market forces are overpowering the forced parity of bond notes face imprisonment of up to seven years. This comes after President Robert Mugabe on Friday signed into law the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Amendment Act, 2017 (No. 1 of 2017) that has regularised the circulation of bond notes. A bond note unit &mdash; limited for domestic commerce &mdash; has been fixed by the RBZ to trade at par with one US dollar. But retailers have low confidence in the bond notes and place different price tags on goods dependent on the currency used to pay for the item.
