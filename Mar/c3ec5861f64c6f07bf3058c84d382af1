HARARE - Dual-listed financial services group, NMB Zimbabwe (NMBZ), has sold off just over $12,7 million of bad loans, almost completing the disposal of its toxic portfolio. The group&rsquo;s chief executive, Benefit Washaya, last week said his organisation was cleaning its balance sheet to make it attractive to international financiers. This comes as the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-listed financial services group has recorded a decline in loan and advances to $205,9 million last year from $243,2 million in 2015 on the back of harsh economic conditions which resulted in constrained lending.&nbsp; Washaya said NMBZ was targeting a non-performing ratio of five percent by year end from the current 10,7 percent. In the half year to June 2016, the group&rsquo;s NPL ratio came down from 14,9 percent as at June 30, 2015 to 11,1 percent driven by aggressive collection efforts and bad loans valued at $11,6 million were shelved to Zamco. In the full year to December last year, NMBZ profit after tax reduced 7,8 percent to $5 million on the back of&nbsp; &ldquo;extreme pressure&rdquo; from limits placed on interest rate charges and fees. &ldquo;The interest caps, controlled transactional and plastic money fees had an adverse effect on our performance which we had to partly counter through increased volumes,&rdquo; Washaya said. However, the bank&rsquo;s net interest income was up 10,3&nbsp; percent from $20,6 million to $22,8 million, while fees and commissions income slumped 27,7&nbsp; percent to $15,2 million. At $260,6 million, total deposits were six percent down from $277,2 million recorded prior comparable period, on the back of funding opportunities.&nbsp; The bank&rsquo;s liquidity ratio was up to 40,06 percent from 30,04 percent, while operating expenses dropped three percent from $26,9 million to $26,2 million. Impairment losses on loans and advances declined from $9,5 million in the previous year to $8,1 million on the back of strict credit underwriting.&nbsp; The group&rsquo;s total assets declined by four percent from $333,8 million in the previous year to $320,9 million on the back of a 15 percent fall in loan and advances. At $50,2 million, the bank&rsquo;s capitalisation remained above the minimum central bank capital requirement of $25 million. Washaya noted that the London Stock Exchange-listed group&rsquo;s focus going forward was going to be on cost optimisation, reduction and rationalisation.
