HARARE - Dendera musician Suluman Chimbetu has been dragged to court by his ex-wife Marygold Mutemasango after&nbsp; allegedly defaulting on payment of $1 600 maintenance for the upkeep of their two minor children. Chimbetu, who was represented by Simudzai Machingauta, appeared before Harare magistrate Joy Chikodzore yesterday and was released on free bail until the commencement of his trial on March 30. Prosecutor Devoted Nyagano alleged that on December 20 last year, Chimbetu was ordered to pay $800 as maintenance towards the upkeep of his two minor children. The money was supposed to be paid with effect from December 31, 2016 and deposited into Mutemasango&rsquo;s bank account. However, Chimbetu only paid maintenance for December and defaulted on the January and February payments. As a result, Chimbetu was subsequently arrested following issuance of a warrant. In December last year, Mutemasango caused a stir at Chimbetu&rsquo;s wedding with Linda Samuriwo after she stormed Zimbali Gardens in Greendale where the dendera artiste was tying the knot with the intention of disrupting the function. Mutemasango, who is mother to Suluman&rsquo;s two children, stunned guests at the classy event who included music superstar Oliver Mtukudzi when she insisted that she was still legally married to the dendera music star under customary law. Her efforts to stop the wedding ceremony were thwarted by suspected plain clothes policemen who whisked her away from the wedding. As a result of the fracas, the wedding ceremony which was scheduled to start at 11am, only got underway three hours later. The delay saw other high profile guests like Tuku and his wife Daisy leaving&nbsp; the wedding ceremony prematurely.
