HARARE - Agribank&#39;s revival continues after the agriculture-focused financial institution posted a $4,8 million profit in the full year to December 2016. This compares favourably with a loss of $6,3 million recorded in the same period in 2015. &ldquo;This positive performance marked an indication of the solid turnaround for the bank premised on the implementation of a range of turnaround initiatives following the capitalisation of the bank in 2015,&rdquo; Agribank chief executive Sam Malaba said yesterday. The bank recorded an increase of 45,2 percent in net interest income in 2016 to close the year with $25,9 million compared to $17,8 million for the prior year. Malaba said the bank&rsquo;s non-interest income closed the year at $5,3 million. &ldquo;Notwithstanding bank charges reduction in 2016, the bank&rsquo;s non-interest income remained constant as a result of the implementation of e-banking channels in the second half of the year,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the period under review, Agribank had a healthy liquidity position, with a liquidity ratio of 49 percent compared to 37 percent in 2015 while total assets rose 18,6 percent to $204 million. By the end of last year, the bank was adequately capitalised with Tier 1 capital of $51,1 million compared to regulatory minimum of $25 million.
