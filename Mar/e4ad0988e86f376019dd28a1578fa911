HARARE - Zimbabwe&#39;s cricket team will get the much-needed game time after they were invited to tour Sri Lanka in June later this year. With the leading cricket nations not keen to tour Zimbabwe, Heath Streak&rsquo;s side is always short of game time. Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) chairperson Tavengwa Mukuhlani earlier this month embarked on an Asian trip in a bid to try and seek partnerships. Apart from Sri Lanka, Mukuhlani also visited India and Pakistan to drum up support from the like-minded boards as they also battle to stop the ICC reforms which will usher in a new two-tier Test system from passing through. &ldquo;We are looking forward to sending our Under-19s to Sri Lanka and Pakistan while Sri Lanka again has offered to take our national team for training as well as our A team...we are actually going there in June this year,&rdquo; Mukuhlani told the Daily News. Sri Lanka are one of the Test-playing nations that have maintained a cordial relationship with ZC over the years despite Zimbabwe&rsquo;s troubles both on and off the field. Sri Lanka were in Zimbabwe last October for a two-match Test series before West Indies joined in later for an ODI tri-series won by the Asians after they beat the hosts in the final in Bulawayo.
