BULAWAYO - How Mine coach Kelvin Kaindu was left disappointed with his side&rsquo;s failure to convert the numerous chances they created in the goalless draw against FC Platinum at Barbourfields Stadium yesterday. The gold miners had been on a four-match winning streak before yesterday&rsquo;s encounter but missed some good chances to extend that run. &ldquo;I think its two vital points that we lost at home. We had opportunities to win the game in the first half but we failed to utilise our chances,&rdquo; Kaindu said. &ldquo;It was a difficult game, where both teams didn&rsquo;t play their usual game. We are always offensive and creating those chances but our conversion rate is not good and we need to work on that.&rdquo; FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza was also not pleased with how his side had failed to find the target. &ldquo;Like I said the other time, it&rsquo;s always about missing chances. We are not scoring. Second half we really pushed and created opportunities that we did not utilise,&rdquo; Mapeza said. &ldquo;Football is about winning matches by scoring. Without scoring your ball possession won&rsquo;t count. People won&rsquo;t accept it if we don&rsquo;t score. Its work in progress we will go and rectify our mistakes.&rdquo; Kuda Musharu could have opened the scoring in the 20th minute but his shot from inside the box hit the cross bar after being set by Godfrey Nguwodzawo. Before that Chikurupati anchorman Marvellous Mukumba had wasted an opportunity to break the deadlock after he failed to connect an Adolf Muganyi cross with only FC Platinum goalkeeper Peros Mhari to beat. Gift Mbweti failed to take advantage of the How Mine defence&rsquo;s lapse in concentration moments later when he shot weakly at goal after being setup by Charles Sibanda. In the second period, Rodwell Chinyengetere had a chance to score but his shot was blocked for a corner by Praise Tonha. Mbweti then failed to beat How Mine keeper Munyaradzi Diya in a one-on-one situation.
