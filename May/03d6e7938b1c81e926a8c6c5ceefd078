HARARE - The African Medallion Group (AMG) is next week expected to launch another batch of its gold medallions to commemorate the African Union (AU)&rsquo;s 54th anniversary, officials say. This also comes as debate over the use of these bullion coins as a future currency and the need for greater beneficiation of the yellow metal through such initiatives has gathered momentum. &ldquo;With the special and quarter ounce medallions having a nominal value or price of just $5, AMG believes demand will rise in the future and any further purchases will be done in consultation with the (original) 100 piece holders to be notified through a closed loop trading system,&rdquo; founder and promoter Frank Buyanga said. &ldquo;This gives all initial subscribers potential to secure greater returns in future. The guaranteed buy back amount is fixed at $5 (per) each medallion. However, future value will be determined in trade amount,&rdquo; he said, adding the dedication to the half-a-century old AU had also arisen from one of the continental body&rsquo;s core ideas or objectives of &ldquo;fostering unity and economic integration&rdquo;. Having released an initial 10 medallions in SA and which were quickly snapped up by entrepreneur Sandile Shezi in early April, AMG believes its precious mineral-backed products would be key for wealth preservation and diversifying income streams for African investors.
