ALEXANDRIA &ndash; Ronald Chitiyo says Zimbabwean champions CAPS United are relishing their underdog tag status ahead of this evening&rsquo;s Africa Champions League Group B opener against Egyptian giants Zamalek. The Green Machine, who arrived here yesterday face Zamalek at Borg El Arab Stadium hoping to kick start their campaign on a positive note. And Chitiyo, who joined CAPS United following the expiry of his contract with Harare City and has played an important role in the team&rsquo;s qualifying stages, believes the fact that they are the underdogs could give them an edge over the five time African champions. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always good to be underdogs because it means we have got nothing to lose and we can go there and play our normal game,&rdquo; Chitiyo told the Daily News. &ldquo;We just need to play our normal game. And in any case Zamelek are the ones who are under pressure since they will be at home and most people are viewing us as the weeping boys in our group.&rdquo; Chitiyo said the reigning league champions are ready and prepared for the match.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think we are ready for the match because we don&rsquo;t really need more motivation other than the match itself,&rdquo; Chitiyo said. &ldquo;There is no doubt that matches of the magnitude are difficult games but as CAPS United we need to have the belief that we can do it. We need to fight and work as a team stay focussed for throughout the match. &ldquo;We always play to win and there is no difference in this game we are going out there looking for a positive result. &ldquo;Of course they are great team with great history but in football anything is possible. We have our targets and I believe all the teams in our group have equal chances of progressing to the knockout stages.&rdquo;
