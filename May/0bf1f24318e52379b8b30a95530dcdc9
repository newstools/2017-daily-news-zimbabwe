HARARE - Two Chitungwiza men reportedly murdered and stripped-naked a guitarist on his way back home from a choir rehearsal, a Harare court has heard. Tapiwa Mangai, 37, and Solomon Gochera, 27, of Unit D in Seke, Chitungwiza appeared before Harare magistrate Barbra Chimboza on Saturday facing murder charges. The duo was remanded in custody and advised to apply for bail at the High Court because they are facing a third schedule offence. Prosecutor Nancy Chandakaona alleged that on November 9 last year around 11am, the now deceased Nigel Mutava went to Praise and Worship Church in Unit D in Seke, Chitungwiza for choir rehearsals. The court heard that around 8pm, he left the church with other members but later parted ways as he proceeded to his residence. It was alleged that along the way, Mutava was allegedly attacked by Mangai and his accomplices &mdash; who are on the run &mdash; and fell to the ground. Mangai and his gang reportedly stripped Mutava of his jean trousers and used it to tie his hands and legs. The court heard that they strangled Mutava to death and took his guitar, shoes, and satchel containing the now deceased person&rsquo;s valuables. Mangai and his accomplices fled from the scene. A post mortem conducted by Mauriko Gonzalez concluded that death was due to asphyxia caused by strangulation. Police made follow-ups on the culprits behind Mutava&rsquo;s brutal murder and on May 11 arrested Gochera in Mbare. During police &ldquo;interviews&rdquo;, Gochera implicated Mangai. He was subsequently arrested in town before allegedly making indications of how the offence was committed at the crime scene.
