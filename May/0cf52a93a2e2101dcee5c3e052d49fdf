HARARE - Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere&rsquo;s suspension of Chitungwiza councillors is unconstitutional, the Chitungwiza Residents Trust (Chitrest) has said. Last week, Kasukuwere suspended the town&rsquo;s 25 councillors, including the Mayor Phillip Mutoti, over corruption allegations. The councillors, accused of allegedly contravening Section 114 of the Urban Councils Act, are also charged of gross incompetence, misconduct and wilful violation of the law in the management of the council&rsquo;s funds and affairs.
