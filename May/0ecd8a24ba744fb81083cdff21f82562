HARARE - Three #Tajamuka leaders were yesterday acquitted of charges of mobilising against the introduction of bond notes last year. The trio &mdash; #Tajamuka spokesperson Promise Mkwananzi, 35, Mehluli Dube, 35, and 23-year-old Kudakwashe Manjonjo &mdash; were facing charges of addressing a media briefing and participating in a gathering with the intention to promote public violence or criminal nuisance. They were acquitted after a full trial before Harare magistrate Nomsa Sabarauta, who ruled that the State had failed to prove a prima facie case against the activists. Sabarauta said that the witnesses and evidence produced in court was not tangible &ldquo;hence no reasonable court would convict an accused person based on that information&rdquo;. The three were represented by Webster Jiti. Prosecutor Audrey Chogumaira had alleged that on November 28 last year at Corner Rezende Street and Jason Moyo Avenue in Harare, Mkwananzi was in the company of other members of Tajamuka clad in T-shirts inscribed Tajamuka, Enough is Enough, No to bond notes, #hatichada, #hatichatya. The court heard that accused persons took turns to address a gathering of about 25 people, allegedly inciting them to shun the introduction of bond notes and alleged corruption by senior government officials. It was alleged that Mkwananzi and his team encouraged the gathered public to participate in violent demonstrations in which they allegedly vowed to attack police officers who stood in their way.
