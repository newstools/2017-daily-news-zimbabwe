HARARE - Information Communication Technology Supa Mandiwanzira bought a copy of Zimdancehall star Seh Calaz&rsquo;s DVD for $2 500 on Wednesday night at The Volt. Mandiwanzira, who was the guest of honour at the launch of a compilation of 15 videos by the Mumota Murikubvira hit-maker, said the whopping amount he paid for the DVD was a sign of his own commitment and that of the government to the arts. &ldquo;Seh Calaz is a talented young man and I&rsquo;m proud to grace the event &hellip;Zimdancehall has helped put Zimbabwe on the map and as a government we are fully behind the arts,&rdquo; the minister told a colourful launch party graced by artistes such as Suluman Chimbetu, Stunner, Freeman, Killer T, Mudiwa, BaShupi and Carlos Green. Mandiwanzira added that he identified with artistes like Mbare-born Seh Calaz. &ldquo;I grew up in the ghetto and this is why I am fully behind ghetto youths&hellip; I want Zimdancehall artistes to unite so that they can show their capabilities in singing,&rdquo; he said before throwing a few sentences in Jamaican patois much to the amusement of&nbsp; the gathering. The minister, however, urged Zimdancehall artistes to make use of technology. &ldquo;My ministry is encouraging musicians to embrace information technology as this is in line with modern global trends,&rdquo; said Mandiwanzira. The DVD launch was also attended by Zimbabwe Tourism Authority chief executive officer Karikoga Kaseke who praised Seh Calaz for contributing to the efforts of promoting Zimbabwe as a tourism destination. &ldquo;We happen to have the same drive of promoting our nation, and as such I offer this young man an opportunity to play at a function we will hold on June 2. We also pledge an all-expenses paid trip for Seh Calaz to Victoria Falls with his partner,&rdquo; Kaseke said.
