BULAWAYO - Konke Suzokulungisa, the new album by the Martin Sibanda-led off-shoot of Ndolwane Super Sounds, which was recently launched in Bulawayo and Johannesburg, is anchored on the message of unity. Sibanda and his band use several songs on the album to urge Zimbabweans to tackle challenges facing the country as a united front. The title track of the seven-track album, in particular, which is a blend of IsiNdebele and English, bemoans the lack of unity in the country. Part of the song goes, &ldquo;Ma lisaxabana lithwalelana izikhali kusekude lapho esiya khona&rdquo; which loosely translated means (If we are still fighting one another, we still have a long way to go.) The song goes on to say, &ldquo;Bantu balindawo linga hlutshwa lubala lolu, ngoba kuzakulunga konke lingakhuluma ngazwi linye (Don&rsquo;t be troubled by something so insignificant which you can easily overcome when you are united). It also urges citizens to exercise their right to vote (Hambani liye voter, Sizok&rsquo;lungisa, one man one vote sizok&rsquo;lungisa). Other tracks on the album are Milenje, Milandu, Icilongo, Abantwana, Gr8 and Team Green World. Konke Suzokulungisa is a follow-up album to Sibanda&rsquo;s solo hit album Bakhuzeni which he released five years ago after he had parted ways with Ndolwane Super Sounds co-founder Charles Ndebele. Before Sibanda and Ndebele went separate ways, the united Ndolwane Super Sounds churned about 13 albums. Power struggles between the equally talented composers and vocalists intensified after the death of senior Ndolwane Super Sounds member Abson Ndebele, who was viewed as the band&rsquo;s uniting force. Ndebele passed on in 2007 in a tragic accident along the Bulawayo-Harare highway triggering the implosion of the band.
