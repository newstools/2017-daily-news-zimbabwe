HARARE - Chipawo children will perform at Girls High School in Harare tonight as part their preparations for their tour of South Africa. The young artistes, who are set to perform at the Cradle of Creativity International Theatre for Children and Young People and the 19th International Association of Theatre for Children and Young People (Assitej) World Congress Festival which will run in South Africa between May 16 and 27, will stage a production called My Culture, My Strength, My Identity (Mavara) tonight. The play they are performing tonight was first staged in Lingen, Germany at the 13th World Festival of Children&rsquo;s Theatre before being taken to Svenborg, Denmark as part of an exchange programme. The play revolves around how Mwari (God) created the world and everything. Given that different countries in the world were given different things, the play asks the pertinent question: What did Mwari give to Zimbabwe? According to Chipawo manager Chipo Basopo, tonight&rsquo;s performance will be a perfect platform for them to fine-tune their preparations for the tour of South Africa. &ldquo;In South Africa, apart from the play, I will also present a paper on theatre for children and young people, demonstrating Chipawo&rsquo;s work with children for over three decades. I will also be part of the Assitej next generation team.&nbsp; All Chipawo&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s expenses will be covered by Assitej South Africa,&rdquo; she said.
