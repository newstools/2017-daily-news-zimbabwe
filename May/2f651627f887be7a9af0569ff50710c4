HARARE - Two Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) art students will present an exhibition of their artwork in Harare later this month. Fourth year student Chenai Motsi said her exhibition, titled &ldquo;Expressions,&rdquo; will include media ranging from painting, drawing, photography, print media, print making, ceramics, graphic design and environmental designs. &ldquo;This exhibition will depict my emotions, beliefs and the things I have experienced and felt throughout my life,&rdquo; Motsi said. The avid disciple of Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent Willem van Gogh, who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art, said she was discovering herself through art. &ldquo;Van Gogh used various styles of painting and approaches to express his unique view of the world: more geometric and definitive forms, unnatural, bold and simplified colours and sometimes symbolic content. In the same way, I have also used beauty, emotion and colour to express myself through art,&rdquo; said the 23-year-old. Motsi&rsquo;s exhibition will run from May 31 to June 2, 2017&nbsp; with the official opening slated for June 1.&nbsp; Another student, Kudakwashe Chitauro said he will be holding his exhibition at Haig Park Junior School in Mabelreign from May 29 to 31, 2017. &ldquo;My exhibition called &ldquo;Matsimba &mdash; the voyage trail&rdquo; showcases what I have learnt in the past four years,&rdquo; he said. The fine arts student said although he initially had no appreciation for art, he has fallen in love with the sector. &ldquo;My paintings, drawings, graphic designs, photography, 3 D works, ceramics, mixed media and print making, portray emotions and things that happen in society such as child and women abuse as well as the current harsh economic environment. Both exhibitions are free to the public.
