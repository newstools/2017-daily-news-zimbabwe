MANCHESTER - An explosion struck an Ariana Grande concert attended by thousands of young music fans in northern England, killing at least 22 people and injuring dozens in what police said on Tuesday they suspected was a terrorist attack. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins says police are treating the blast as an act of terrorism &quot;until we know otherwise&quot;. The local ambulance service says 59 people were taken to hospitals. Manchester police say an apparent suicide bomber set off an improvised explosive device at the end of an Ariana Grande concert.
