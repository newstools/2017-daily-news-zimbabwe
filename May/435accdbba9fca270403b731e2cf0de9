HARARE - South Africa-based gospel artiste Togarepi &ldquo;Toggy&rdquo; Chivaviro featured music superstar Oliver Tuku &ldquo;Mtukudzi&rdquo; on the remix of his track titled Handinyarare&nbsp; set to be released tomorrow. The single, mixed by Blessing Masanga of Artisan Studios and mastered at Kubashe BK studios in Johannesburg, was originally on Chivaviro&rsquo;s 11th studio album &mdash; Mhepo Inoperekedza. According to Chivaviro, the remix was done at the request of Tuku. &ldquo;After listening to the track from the album Mhepo Inoperekedza, baba Mtukudzi just requested to remix the song and add something to it because it was touching him in a special way. &ldquo;I could not turn down such a humbling request from a legend like Tuku and I knew God was saying something through him about the song,&rdquo; said the Ebenezer Tiri Munyasha singer. Chivaviro added that the remixed Handinyarare track is different from his other songs. &ldquo;This track is unique in that it is more of a prayer from a soul that needs to directly address his or her issues to Jesus. &ldquo;It also encourages people to rather not sit back and relax in this day of microwave Christianity where people just want easy things coming their way without creating a direct relationship with God,&rdquo; he said The new song, according to the gospel star, will be given out for free. &ldquo;Initially we wanted to include it on the Maranatha album, but I felt it is a special remix that we want everyone to have access to, therefore we are releasing it as a single to give it that special place and to allow us to give it out for free to our fans via all kinds of media,&rdquo; Chivaviro said. The collaboration with Tuku is expected to take Chivaviro&rsquo;s brand to new heights. His previous albums include Peace, Hope and Love (1999), Power (2000), Best of Rev TT Chivaviro (2006),&nbsp; The Return (2009), Ishe Taungana (2013) and Ebenezer Tiri Munyasha.
