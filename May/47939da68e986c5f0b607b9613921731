MUTARE - Shabanie Mine coach Takesure Chiragwi believes his side is on the right track to safety after recent good performances. The Chinda Boys, who returned to the top flight league this season, currently sit in ninth place on the log with nine points from eight matches. This season, they have already drawn with defending champions CAPS United and beat Bulawayo giants Highlanders in their own backyard at Barbourfields Stadium. At the weekend, Shabanie battled to a 0-0 draw against fellow Midlands side Chapungu at Maglas Stadium. With such a solid start upon their return to the big boys club, Chiragwi is confident they can be assured of another season the Premier League next season. &ldquo;This is a marathon; we are coming in from Division One and the boys are combining well. I&rsquo;m not panicking, we have the same objective with the club&rsquo;s executive to avoid relegation and we are working on that,&rdquo; he said. At the weekend, the Chinda Boys have another chance to claim a big scalp when they travel to Harare to take on Dynamos. Having already gone to Bulawayo and upset Bosso, Chiragwi sees no harm in dreaming of adding another victim to some of the famous results they have managed this season.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I respect Dynamos as a club but in the field we are all the same as we play in the same league,&rdquo; Chiragwi said. &ldquo;They are just like any other team we have played before or better still like any other team we are going to play in the future so the respect they can get from us is that of a big club status only, so let the best team on the day win it.&rdquo;
