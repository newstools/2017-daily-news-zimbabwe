HARARE - Hollywood-based Zimbabwean actress Sibongile &ldquo;Sibo&rdquo; Mlambo starred in the movie, Message From the King that was released last week. Sibo, who hogged the limelight last year when she was picked as the lead actress in Universal Pictures&rsquo; third sequel of Honey, played the role of Bianca who &ldquo;disappears&rdquo; after she moves to Los Angeles. Her brother, South African Jacob King, played by Chadwick Boseman, who will feature in Black Panther alongside Zimbabwean star Danai Gurira, moves to Los Angeles desperate to find Bianca and establish what happened to her. Message from the King, which is Belgian Fabrice Du Welz&rsquo;s first English-language feature, also featured top actors like Luke Evans, Teresa Palmer and Alfred Molina Sibo, who is currently in Canada on a Netflix assignment, is hopeful her role in Message From the King will take her acting career a notch up. &ldquo;Message From the King was the first movie I worked on in Los Angeles and that was two years ago in 2015. &ldquo;I was in a new environment and I was nervous but excited. I hope it does take my career to the next level,&rdquo; she told the Daily News. Interestingly, when she joined the Message From the King set in 2015, Sibo didn&rsquo;t realise that Boseman &mdash; her brother in the movie &mdash; was an actor on the rise. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t worked with Boseman before and I didn&rsquo;t know who he was. He had just been announced as Black Panther and I didn&rsquo;t know how big a deal that was either. To me he was a polite, talented actor,&rdquo; she said. Though she enjoyed being Bianca in Message From the King, Sibo is not convinced that it is her best role to date. &ldquo;I think it would be my role on Teen Wolf (a forthcoming MTV series) which completely surprised me and became my dream role. It just hasn&rsquo;t come out yet so I can&rsquo;t say if it was my best role to date but I did thoroughly enjoy it,&rdquo; the rising Hollywood actress explained. Apart from Teen Wolf, Sibo will also be part of an upcoming crime thriller called Under the Silver Lake and forthcoming anthology thriller titled Dark/Web. Sibo, who has featured in movies such as Black Sails and Last Face, harbours big dreams. &ldquo;In the next five years I will be producing shows for television and have a leading role on a show which means I will be loaded and travelling around the world,&rdquo; she boldly predicted. The success that is coming thick and fast to her in Hollywood appears not to have made her forget her roots. &ldquo;I am Ndau and come from Mt. Selinda in Chipinge. I am from a family which is very rooted in the arts. &ldquo;I have a twin brother called Bongani who is an extremely talented cinematographer and one of my older sisters, Nomsa, was Tamari in the 1995 Zimbabwean&nbsp; movie Everyone&rsquo;s Child and my other sister, Busi, was Miss Zim-USA,&rdquo; Sibo said.
