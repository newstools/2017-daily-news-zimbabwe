HARARE - After a bruising and intense battle with the Matabeleland Warriors forwards on Saturday, Old Georgians prop David Makanda praised the vanquished Bulawayo side for a spirited performance. The Dragons emerged with a hard-fought 26-0 victory over the Bulawayo-based side at Police Grounds to go top of the Intercity Rugby League table. OGs huffed and puffed in the first half but they could not find a way past the Mat Warriors defence. In the end, OGs finally scored four unanswered tries in the second half through wing Stephan Hunduza, Makanda and hooker Graham Cochrane. It was clear the visitors had begun to run out of fuel in the tank when Grant Mitchell&rsquo;s side began to punch holes in their defence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Makanda admitted that they won the match due to their superior conditioning which meant they continued to press on despite the frustrating first 40 minutes. &ldquo;These guys were well prepared; they had a plan and they came at us. As you could see; in the first half we were defending all day and in there second half, here and there, they let us go in and we ended up with the win,&rdquo; Makanda said of the victory. &ldquo;They had us but we wanted it more. I&rsquo;m sure we work harder than them; I&rsquo;m not saying they don&rsquo;t train but since we once played in the Gold Cup and we are aiming to go there again, we were on a bit higher level than them. &ldquo;Personally, I do not want to lose because for me losing is not an option. I said to the guys &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s take it to them. Heads up; this is a game of rugby. It&rsquo;s a game of 80 minutes and the best team always wins&rsquo;.&rdquo; The former Old Hararians front rower is already having a memorable season with his new side. Saturday&rsquo;s five pointer was the tighthead&rsquo;s fourth of the season and the prop is excited by how he is getting on the score sheet regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;For a prop to score four tries in four games only this season is a good achievement. Some other clubs can go for a whole season without scoring a try,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This season, I&rsquo;m working hard and I think I&rsquo;m one of the best mobile props in Zim at the moment.&rdquo;
