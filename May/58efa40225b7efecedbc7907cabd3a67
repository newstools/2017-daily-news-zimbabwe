HARARE - Government will not be settling the $150 million-plus Premier Service Medical Aid Society (Psmas) debt any time soon because it has other competing commitments, Public Service minister Prisca Mupfumira has said. She was responding to Gutu South Zanu PF MP Paul Chimedza who had asked what government was doing about its debts to health service providers, during Wednesday&rsquo;s question and answer time in the National Assembly. The former deputy Health minister said: &ldquo;People are now moving to India because we are starving our own system with the money that we owe. When are we going to settle the bill for Psmas so that we capacitate them to pay service providers and then we bring our private health system up to scratch?&rdquo; Chimedza questioned, adding &ldquo;...the minister should be at the pulse of what is happening with this issue&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;It should concern you and we need some sort of idea that this thing is on the radar of both ministers and they are working on it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response, Mupfumira said Psmas was not the only service provider owed. &ldquo;We are aware of the current liquidity challenges and I am not here to say it will be today or tomorrow,&rdquo; Mupfumira said. &ldquo;I have other equally important issues which require the minister of Finance ...; hence I have said I will follow through to find out the latest status on the issue.&rdquo; &ldquo;My ministry is not responsible for remittance of payments to service providers.&nbsp; I will follow up the issue with the minister of Finance .. to find out what the latest status is on Psmas,&rdquo; she added. &nbsp;
