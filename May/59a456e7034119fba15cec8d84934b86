ALEXANDRIA - After losing to Egyptian giants Zamalek in their African Champions League Group B opening match, there was more bad news for CAPS United after the injury to captain Hardlife Zvirekwi. The Green Machine had done well to hold the White Knights in the first half but they conceded two headed goals from Bassem Morsi and substitute Stanley Ohawuchi in the second period at the Borg El Arab Stadium. Makepekepe coach Lloyd Chitembwe revealed that his skipper would be ruled out for at least two to three weeks. Zvirekwi, one of the standout performers for the Green Machine against the White Knights, pulled a muscle towards the end of the game. His injury is a big blow for United as they are fighting on two fronts with important fixtures in the next 14 days for the Zimbabwean champions. &ldquo;Hardy is likely to be out for the next two to three weeks because of fatigue-inspired injury,&rdquo; Chitembwe said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad but we just hope he recovers and continue from where he left off. He pulled a muscle towards the end of the game. &ldquo;I knew one day it was going to catch up with him and it&rsquo;s very unfortunate because he has played continuous football for more than 14 months.&rdquo; Zvirekwi&rsquo;s injury will force Chitembwe to make some tweaks with his squad and he believes he has capable cover.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will definitely not be part of the team that will play in our upcoming league matches (against ZPC Kariba and Chicken Inn) and also our next champions league fixture against USM Alger next week,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He will be greatly missed because his experience is invaluable to the team. &ldquo;But we will try and see what we can do to move forward. We will push Vale at the right back, Ronny leftback and with Rusike back I am sure we will find balance.&rdquo;
