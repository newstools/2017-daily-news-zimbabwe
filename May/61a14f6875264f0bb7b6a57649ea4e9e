HARARE - Comanche Brave romped to victory in the Castle Tankard main race with the winning connections walking away with the $30 000 top prize as the South African horse justified its 7/2 pre-race odd here yesterday. The four-year-old Kahal gelding had shown grade form coming into yesterday&rsquo;s Grade 1 race after having ran 14 times and placed in seven races, winning four. With Sean Veale on pilot duty, the Amy Bronkhorst-trained horse came home first ahead of another four-year-old South African gelding in second place while pre-race favourite Mathematician was in third. Kirk Sawnson&rsquo;s Windingo finished in fourth place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comanche Brave owner Dave Samuels was naturally elated with the win. &ldquo;I can tell you something that I have had this horse for eight months; it&rsquo;s done probably five wins out of 10 races,&rdquo; Samuels said. &ldquo;To win this in this short space of time is unbelievable. This is one of those things that you can&rsquo;t really express in terms of words. But it&rsquo;s amazing and its fantastic I wish everyone could have a feeling like this.&rdquo;
