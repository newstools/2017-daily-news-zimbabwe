HARARE - Scrapping of government&rsquo;s imports ban policy &mdash; Statutory Instrument (SI) 64 &mdash; is long overdue, as the measure was &ldquo;ill-advised and never the solution&rdquo; for Zimbabwe&rsquo;s deepening economic crisis, economists and industry players said. This comes amid flip-flop in government&rsquo;s position on the policy &mdash; which escalates long-standing concerns on lack of clarity and certainty of the investment-starved southern African country&rsquo;s policies &mdash; by Industry minister Mike Bimha. On Saturday, Bimha said government was moving to scrap the controversial SI64, which has seen hard-pressed consumers bear the brunt of Zimbabwean industries&rsquo; incompetence by paying more for their overpriced local commodities as compared to affordable imports, arguing that it had achieved its objectives, but more importantly, he acknowledged that the protectionist measure had ran into challenges that can only be addressed by scrapping it. &ldquo;To address the challenge of the threat of retaliation from our trading partners, government will replace the import management programme (SI64) with a local content policy,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying in the State media. The policy&rsquo;s challenges, he admitted, included creating a balance between preserving jobs in the imports-focused retail and distribution firms and in the local manufacturing industries. However, in an apparent shift of position &mdash; which proves that ruling Zanu PF government&rsquo;s policies are murky, thereby dampening investor confidence &mdash; Bimha told State media, hardly 24 hours later, that government will not scrap the policy. &ldquo;It could take several months, or even years, before it (local content policy) comes into effect,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying. But despite his vacillation, economists said the policy &ndash; introduced last year, banning importation of cooking oil, cereals, sugar and creamers, among many other basics &ndash; was ill-advised &ldquo;right from the start&rdquo;. Respected economist Ashok Chakravati also a consultant to President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s office and Cabinet, told the Daily News that &ldquo;when SI 64 was put in place, I was against it&rdquo;. &ldquo;This is because the country was unilaterally contravening trade protocols that were already in place and certain procedures that needed to be followed were neglected. While it is true that sometimes we do need protection for a short period, a blanket ban was not the way to go,&rdquo; he said.
