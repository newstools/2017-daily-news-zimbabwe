HARARE - Former Vice President Joice Mujuru yesterday led women from various opposition parties calling for their increased participation and representation in both Parliament and the government after next year&rsquo;s make-or-break national elections. The campaign comes weeks after opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and Mujuru signed a much-talked about memorandum of understanding, in preparation for the formation of a fully-fledged opposition alliance which will take on President Robert Mugabe and Zanu PF in 2018. Uniting under a campaign dubbed #Hervotewins2018, the initiative seeks to empower women to vote for each other in next year&rsquo;s elections, as well as participate as candidates in the watershed plebiscite.
