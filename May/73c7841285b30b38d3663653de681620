HARARE - Flag carrier, Air Zimbabwe, plumbed to new lows on Tuesday after it was banned from flying into Europe over safety concerns. The latest dose of bad news to hit Air Zim comes as the debt-ridden airline is barely managing to stay afloat, and to keep operating its creaky aircraft &mdash; a development which has lately forced its single biggest customer, President Robert Mugabe, to hire private jets. At the same time, analysts told the Daily News yesterday that the European ban was likely to further complicate Mugabe&rsquo;s travelling plans to international events there, which are not covered by the current travel restrictions on him.
