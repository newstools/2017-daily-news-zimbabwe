HARARE - Mhai singer Tocky Vibes, who is no longer very active on the local concert scene, will make a rare appearance tonight at the City Sports Bar. Tocky Vibes will share the stage with controversial rapper Stunner in a gig dubbed &ldquo;Afribbean Night&rdquo;. According to Brian &ldquo;Hollyman&rdquo; Hazangwi, the Toti Toti singer&rsquo;s manager, Tocky Vibes has promised a show to remember. &ldquo;It is going to be a memorable show, Tocky Vibes is going to perform both new and old tracks,&rdquo; said Hazangwi. Tocky Vibes rubbed his zimdancehall fans the wrong way two years ago when he largely ditched the zimdancehall genre on his 2015 debut album Toti Toti. But the 23-year-old was defiant. He justified the move as a necessary step in his progression as an artiste. &ldquo;I have no regrets for Toti Toti. Critics say I short-changed my fans when I moved from riding on zimdancehall beats (riddims) but I don&rsquo;t agree. Toti Toti is my first album in the true sense as everything on it belongs to me. &ldquo;I cannot take pride in riddims since they are not my creations but someone else&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Tocky Vibes told the Daily News soon after releasing the 2015 album. Tocky Vibes could, however, be upstaged tonight by the controversial Stunner whose popularity appears to have gone a notch up ever since he acrimoniously parted ways with ex-wife Olinda Chapel. The award-winning Zim hip- hop star is expected to perform songs off his latest 16-track album titled If I die Tonight and his 15-track album Ndaita Mbiri which he released in 2013. Stunner, whose albums include are Hameno, Kalife, Team Hombe, Number One and Can&rsquo;t Stop Me, could also perform the song Ndoenda which was inspired by messy break-up with Olinda. Interestingly, Stunner featured award-winning comedian Samantha &ldquo;Gonyeti&rdquo; Kureya on the video for the song.
