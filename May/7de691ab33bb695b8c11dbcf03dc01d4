HARARE - Mbira princess Hope Masike and Afro-jazz bassist-cum-vocalist Josh Meck and South Africa-based lead guitarist Louis Mhlanga will be part of Mahube when the collective of southern African musicians led by acclaimed South African saxophonist Steve Dyer performs at Joburg Theatre on Saturday. Masike and Meck will be joined in the new-look Mahube by Xixel Langa (Mozambique) and Siya Makuzeni (South Africa) for the gig in which they will share the stage with Paco S&eacute;ry and the African Beat (Ivory Coast), Nathi (South Africa) and The Parlotones (South Africa.) The Joburg Theatre concert is a follow-up to Mahube&rsquo;s scintillating performance at the Harare International Festival of Arts (Hifa) at the beginning of this month where their line-up featured music superstar Oliver &ldquo;Tuku&rdquo; Mtukudzi , South African vocalist Mbuso Khoza, Sam Mataure (drums) and Othnell &ldquo;Mangoma&rdquo; Moyo on percussion. Dyer, who formed Mahube in the late 1990s, explained the absence of Tuku, Mataure and Moyo this time around. &ldquo;With a collaboration such as this, you can imagine trying to manage everyone&rsquo;s diaries. The concept stays constant though,&rdquo; said Dyer, who led a band called Southern Freeway in Zimbabwe in the early 1990s before relocating to his homeland, South Africa in 1993. The acclaimed South African saxophonist and composer added that he was delighted by the way Mahube performed at this year&rsquo;s edition of Hifa. &ldquo;In its time, the original Mahube was so special for me. And now the Hifa opening Mahube line-up was different but so special as well. &ldquo;At that time (when Mahube was formed), the aim of Mahube was to showcase music and artistes from the southern African region. The intention is the same this time around, and in so doing, give a platform to some younger artistes who are doing exciting and creative things,&rdquo; he told the Daily News.
