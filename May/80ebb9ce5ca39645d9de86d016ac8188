HARARE - Zimbabwe A will be looking for a more clinical batting performance when they take on Canada in the second one-day game at Harare Sports Club today. The hosts will win the three-match series if they triumph in today&rsquo;s match after having secured a two-wicket victory in the first match on Tuesday. Canada had won the toss and elected to bat first before reaching a total of 248 for six with their opener Bhavindu Adhihetty scoring a half century 70. Zimbabwe&rsquo;s chase was anchored by opener Chamu Chibhabha&rsquo;s 65 as the hosts reached 249 for eight from 48.1 overs. At some stage, it looked like the hosts would canter to victory but they began to lose wicket at regular intervals. In the end, a sixth wicket partnership between Malcolm Waller (37) and Timycen Maruma (37) worth 74 runs was crucial as Zimbabwe crossed the finish line with 11 deliveries remaining. Other significant contributions with the bat came from Sean Williams (43) and PJ Moor (45) in the middle order. &ldquo;As a batting unit, we discussed that we need to be finishing the games more clinically,&rdquo; captain Sikandar Raza said after the match. &ldquo;I think the guys will be honest enough to say there was a time when it looked liked we are winning the game convincingly to (only) find ourselves in a bit of bother.&rdquo; In the bowling department, Raza led the way as he took two wickets at the expense of 41 runs from his 10 overs. Tendai Chatara, Solomon Mire, Nathan Waller and Wellington Masakadza all took a wicket a-piece. On the team&rsquo;s bowling and fielding performance, Raza said: &ldquo;We started a little bit better but we were slightly off target at some times. In the field, I think a good number of twos were taken which is a big no, no when we are in the national team. All the catches were taken as the guys were throwing themselves for the team.&rdquo;
