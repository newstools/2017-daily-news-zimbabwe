HARARE - A South African woman suspected to have ingested cocaine and attempted to smuggle it into Zimbabwe is not pregnant as she claimed, a second scan has confirmed. Isaura Masinga, 40, of Germistone, South Africa, is appearing before Harare magistrate Barbra Chimboza facing charges of possession of cocaine. The first scan confirmed the presence of ingested &ldquo;body packs&rdquo; in her abdomen. She was asked to go a CT scan but her lawyer Nickiel Mushangwe had opposed it, arguing it would have serious health repercussions on his client and her unborn baby. She was then sent for a pregnancy test. Prosecutor Michael Reza advised the court that Masinga was not pregnant after all. Mushangwe yesterday consented to a postponement of the case to May 17 for bail application. &ldquo;A second ultra scan has confirmed that the accused person is not pregnant hence a CT scan can now be done without any fear of tempering with her alleged baby,&rdquo; Reza said. When court proceedings commenced, Mushangwe challenged his client&rsquo;s placement on remand on the basis that she had been charged on allegations of possessing a substance that the State had failed to recover from her. He slammed the State for relying on an ultrasound scan at a time his client is pregnant. He argued the scan may have picked the foetus. Reza sad detectives relied on intelligence received that there is a South African woman on an Emirates flight bringing in cocaine to Zimbabwe. &ldquo;They were further advised that if they failed to recover cocaine from her luggage or person, it would be because she preferred transporting it through her stomach. &ldquo;...that was when police checked on the plane&rsquo;s passenger list and discovered that the accused person was on that flight,&rdquo; he said.
