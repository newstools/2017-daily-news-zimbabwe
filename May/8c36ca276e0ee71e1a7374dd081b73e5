BULAWAYO - Black Rhinos moved into second place on the Castle Lager Premiership log standings following their slender 1-0 victory over Bulawayo City in the early kickoff at Barbourfields Stadium yesterday. Stix Mutizwa&rsquo;s side continue to send warning shots to the top flight big boys as they are now on 14 points from seven matches, just one behind log leaders Ngezi Platinum Stars. Many expected the army side to struggle after gaining promotion from the Northern Region Division One as they had not made any major signings to beef up their squad. However, Mutizwa has galvanised his players to play as a team and are difficult to break down. Yesterday, Chauya Chipembere scored a penalty through goalkeeper Hebert Rusawo five minutes after the break. Rhinos were awarded the spot kick after Zibusiso Sibanda had fouled the tricky winger Milton Kureva inside the penalty box. Rusawo sent his opposite number Aaron &ldquo;Arusha&rdquo; Ngwenya the wrong way to secure maximum points for the army side. Chauya Chipembere coach Mutizwa was a happy man with the result which he attributed to hard work in the team. &ldquo;I always tell my boys we are coming from Division One and this is a different league. We have to try and collect as much points in the first half of the season because it&rsquo;s going to be difficult in the second half of the season,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My boys are getting confident with each game;our secret for the wins in hard work and more hard work.&rdquo; Bulawayo City coach Mandla Mpofu said: &ldquo;Of course we are disappointed losing three points at home. First half we played well but we were not creating opportunities. We only created one opportunity the whole 90 minutes. &ldquo;We still have a good team that can compete and win. I think I am not demoralised, we will go back and work.&rdquo; Amakhosi remain in 11th place on the log with eight points from eight matches.
