HARARE - The two-day Time &amp; Jazz Music Festival, which began in the Cresta Oasis Car Park in Harare yesterday, is expected to reach an exciting finale tonight with a performance by crowd favourite Jah Prayzah. The Uzumba-born star, currently rocking the airwaves with Sendekera &mdash; his duet with the award-winning Mafikizolo from South Africa &mdash; is the headline act on an entertainment bill awash with other potentially exciting acts. From 2pm this afternoon, music fans will be entertained by a line-up of artistes that includes Alexio Kawara, Edith WeUtonga, Sam Dondo and ex-Jah Prayzah dancer and backing vocalist Pamela &ldquo;Gonyeti&rdquo; Zulu. In a bid to make the event a true family affair, event organiser Josh Hozheri has included two school bands &mdash; Prince Edward Jazz Band and St George Jazz Band. Last night&rsquo;s line up of performers included dendera star Suluman Chimbetu, seasoned jazz masters Jabavu, the rising Gary Tight and songstress Selmor Mtukudzi. Hozheri told the Daily News that the inclusion of artistes from other genres was part of a strategy to make the festival viable. &ldquo;We did this so as to draw numbers to the festival as jazz music alone will not bring many to the party; this is just a marketing gesture. In doing this, we will also be introducing music fans to jazz. &ldquo;We have also invited two school jazz music outfits &mdash; Prince Edward Jazz Band and St George Jazz Band &mdash; because we want youngsters to attend and this includes school children. &ldquo;We are also giving these young bands a platform to share the stage with seasoned musicians,&rdquo; he said, adding that the venue of the event was the ideal one. &ldquo;This year, we decided to hold the event at Cresta Oasis Car Park because it is spacious. Cresta Oasis Hotel has given us this venue and they will provide braais and drinks of all manner.&rdquo;
