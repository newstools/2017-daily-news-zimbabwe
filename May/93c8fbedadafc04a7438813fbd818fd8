HARARE - Ngezi Platinum Stars coach Tonderai Ndiraya was pleased with his side&rsquo;s fighting spirit as they beat Harare City 1-0 to return to the top of the Castle Lager Premiership log yesterday. Defender Qadr Amini scored a 20th minute penalty to secure the platinum miners second win on the road to take their points tally to 16 from eight matches. Ndiraya&rsquo;s side only other win on the road came last month when they beat Hwange 2-0 at the Colliery. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy with the fight we fought. This is only our second win away from home this season. We have had some good performances away from home in the past games but we could not get good results,&rdquo; Ndiraya said. &ldquo;Today we were not so good especially in the second half but we got the three points that are important to us. &ldquo;We also defended well in the second half. Harare City came back a changed side; they controlled the second half. &ldquo;What is key is that we got our chance and scored to get the three points as we now look forward to our next match.&rdquo; Harare City coach Mike Madzivanyika was disappointed with the way his side failed to win in front of their own fans. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy at all because we are failing to win at home. Today we also created some chances but we failed to score. They got their chance and scored; that was the difference between the two teams today.&rdquo; Ngezi started the match brightly and referee Brighton Chimene awarded them the spot kick after defender Raymond Uchena had brought down the lively Donald Teguru inside the box. It was a bit harsh because Uchena had timed his tackle perfectly as he won the ball first but Chimene saw it differently. Amini made no mistake from 12 yards outs with his spot kick beating City goalkeeper Maxwell Nyamupanendenguto give the visitors the precious lead which they protected for the remainder of the match.
