PARIS - Emmanuel Macron has vowed to fight &quot;the forces of division that undermine France&quot; after easily winning the run-off election for the French presidency. The centrist candidate, 39, defeated the far right&#39;s Marine Le Pen, winning 66.1% of the vote to her 33.9%. Acknowledging his victory, Mr Macron told supporters he wanted to ensure Le Pen voters &quot;no longer have a reason to vote for an extremist position&quot;. There has been a palpable sense of relief among European leaders. Mr Macron was elected on a pro-European Union platform, while Ms Le Pen by contrast threatened to pull out of the single currency and hold an in/out referendum on France&#39;s membership of the EU. In a speech to jubilant supporters, Mr Macron said: &quot;Tonight you won, France won. Everyone told us it was impossible, but they don&#39;t know France.&quot; His win makes him France&#39;s youngest president, and overturns the decades-long dominance of France&#39;s two main political parties. But huge challenges remain, with a third of the electorate choosing Ms Le Pen and even more abstaining or casting a blank ballot. Mr Macron said he had heard &quot;the rage, anxiety and doubt that a lot of you have expressed&quot;, vowing to spend his five years in office &quot;fighting the forces of division that undermine France&quot;.
