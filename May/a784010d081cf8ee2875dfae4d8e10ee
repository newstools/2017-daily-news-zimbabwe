HARARE - CAPS United coach Lloyd Chitembwe is not worried by the Harare derby cancellation just a few days before they travel to Egypt to face Zamalek in the African Champions League. Makepekepe were scheduled to take on Dynamos this Sunday but the match was postponed to a later date due to the unavailability of a venue. The National Sports Stadium is booked for a church service this weekend while the new natural grass playing surface at Rufaro Stadium is not yet ready. Chitembwe, however, feels the calling off of the Harare derby is a blessing in disguise since it gives some of his injured players a rest ahead of the trip to Egypt to face the White Knights. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the cancellation of the derby (against Dynamos) will have any impact on our game against Zamalek because, seriously, playing week in week out is not really important,&rdquo; Chitembwe told the Daily News. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s important is how we prepare. We keep on preparations positive for our game against Zamalek and so far we have no complaints at all. &ldquo;If anything, the players are in good shape and looking forward to the match. &ldquo;Hopefully, some of our players who have been carrying injuries like Tafadzwa Rusike will fully recover in time. He (Rusike) has since started training and we are assessing him.&rdquo; Makepekepe were last in action last weekend when they romped to a 4-0 win over struggling Chapungu at the National Sports Stadium. The Green Machine were pitted in a tough Group B alongside five-time champions Zamalek of Egypt, 2015 finalists USM Alger of Algeria and Al-Ahli Tripoli of Libya. The White Knights are always a difficult opponent especially on home turf at the Cairo International Stadium, a venue where their fans come in huge numbers to fill the 75 000-seater facility.
