HARARE - Ngezi Platinum Stars coach Tonderai Ndiraya won April Coach of the Month while Bantu Rovers forward Bukhosi Sibanda was named the Player of the Month. Ndiraya was rewarded for his team&rsquo;s encouraging start to this year&rsquo;s Castle Lager Premiership campaign, with five wins, a draw and two defeats in their opening eight matches of the season. Sibanda, on the other hand, has been a revelation for the premierships returnees. The 20-year-old striker is the current league&rsquo;s top goal-scorer after hitting the back of the net seven times. Bantu Rovers play Highlanders at Barbourfields Stadium tomorrow and Sibanda is looking forward to continue with his fine form. &ldquo;I am prepared for the game just like the other guys in our team,&rdquo; Sibanda said yesterday. PSL Fixtures: Tomorrow: Chapungu v Harare City ( Ascot), Tsholotsho v Bulawayo City (Dulivhadzimu), Bantu Rovers v Highlanders (Barbourfields), FC Platinum v Yadah (Maglas) Sunday: Ngezi v ZPC Kariba (Baobab), Chicken Inn v CAPS United (postponed), Dynamos v Shabanie Mine (NSS), Triangle v How Mine (Gibbo), Black Rhinos v Hwange (Morris Depot)
