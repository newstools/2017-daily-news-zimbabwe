HARARE - The Dynamos hierarchy will today meet to review the performance of their technical team led by coach Lloyd Mutasa. DeMbare have had an indifferent start to the 2017 Castle Lager Premiership season as they find themselves in 13th place on the log with a paltry eight points from seven matches. At the weekend, DeMbare fans booed and sang disparaging songs directed at Mutasa after the club&rsquo;s&nbsp; 1-1 draw with Shabanie Mine at the National Sports Stadium. In midweek, the Harare giants had suffered their third defeat of the season when they went down 1-0 to newly-promoted Black Rhinos at the same venue. Dynamos president Kenni Mubaiwa said: &ldquo;The results are not coming and we are very concerned. So we are meeting tomorrow (today) to see what could be the problem. We want to hear from the coaches first. For now I can&rsquo;t really say much because it has to be a collective decision. &ldquo;So maybe if you can talk to me tomorrow after our meeting I will be then in a position to tell you the way forward. But the truth of the matter is that we are very concerned with the way the team is currently playing.&rdquo; At the start of the season, the Dynamos bosses had given Mutasa a target of accumulating at least 23 points from the first 10 matches of the season. However, with only three games to go before that 10-game threshold, it is obvious that DeMbare cannot reach that target since there are only nine points to gain. Speaking after the draw with Chinda Boys, Mutasa&nbsp; called for patience from the fans as he asked for more time for his team to get it right. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that you get players from across the country and just a few months into the season people expect you to perform miracles,&rdquo; Mutasa said. &ldquo;This is a process and things are in control. People need to be realistic at times on the way they see things.&rdquo;
