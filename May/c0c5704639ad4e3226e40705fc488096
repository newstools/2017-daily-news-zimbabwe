HARARE - The Zimbabwe A cricket side have won their three-match series against Canada following yesterday&rsquo;s 78-run win in the second one-day game largely thanks to Sean Williams&rsquo; unbeaten century. The hosts had won the first match last Tuesday by two wickets and they now carry an unassailable 2-0 lead. Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza won the toss and elected to bat first. Williams top scored for the hosts with an unbeaten 114 from 112 deliveries while batting at number four to help Zimbabwe A post a competitive 285 for five after 50 overs. Openers Solomon Mire (22) and Chamu Chibhabha (35) had laid a good platform for the rest of the line up. Raza was also just three runs shot of his half century when he was caught and bowled by Junaid Siddiqui. Saad Bin Zafar and Mark Montfort were the pick of the bowlers for Canada with two wickets apiece. In their chase, the Canada batsmen were getting good starts but they were not able to convert them into huge scores. Their top order of Srimantha Wijeratne (15), Durand Soraine (19), Navneet Dhaliwal (39) and Pathiran Dhanuka (23) all got into double figures but they were not able to convert. Captain Hamza Tariq (35) and Varun Sehdev (30) tried to provide some resistance but one they were dismissed the Canada chase was thwarted. Graeme Cremer was the pick of the bowlers for Zimbabwe A with figures of 4/27 from 10 overs. Tendai Chatara picked up two wickets while Raza, Mire, Donald Tiripano, Wellington Masakadza and had a wicket each.
