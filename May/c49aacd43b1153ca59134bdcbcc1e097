HARARE - High Court judge Tawanda Chitapi yesterday extended ex-Air Zimbabwe corporate secretary Grace Pfumbidzayi&rsquo;s bail pending her fresh appeal lodged in the Supreme Court. Pfumbidzayi is challenging her conviction and seven-year imprisonment for criminal abuse of duty, following the recent decision by the High Court to dismiss her appeal. She was jointly charged with the struggling airline&rsquo;s ex-chief executive, Peter Chikumba. Chitapi ordered Pfumbidzayi to remain on $5 000 bail pending the prosecution of the appeal, after State prosecutor Editor Mavuto consented to the application.&nbsp; The current bail process was instigated by Pfumbidzayi&rsquo;s loss of her bid to overturn the Magistrates&rsquo; Court ruling.
