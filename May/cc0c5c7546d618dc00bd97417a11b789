It&rsquo;s only the goals that has not been coming otherwise we are not playing badly. We hope good things will start to roll soon starting with this game against Chapungu.&rdquo; Madzivanyika reckons that despite Chapungu being on the bottom of the table, they will be a tricky opponent at Ascot. &ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s (today) game is also going to be no tougher than any other game and we just know it is going to be very important for us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We need to work hard if we are to take home the three points. We have been telling the boys to go and fight for those three points. The good thing is that the boys are willing to do well so we are yeah, we are positive of maximum points.&rdquo; Chapungu, on the other hand are desperate for maximum points as they are without a win their opening eight matches of the season.
