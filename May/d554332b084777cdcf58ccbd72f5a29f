HARARE - Norton Council has approached the courts seeking a protection order against the town&rsquo;s legislator Temba Mliswa, whom they accuse of harassing the local authority&rsquo;s employees. In an interview with the Daily News this week, the town&rsquo;s chairperson Precious Mufahore, said the protection order was to bar the former Zanu PF official from getting anywhere near the town&rsquo;s council offices. &ldquo;Mliswa has been a menace to the town ever since he became our MP. He hurls insults at management and even threatens councillors and officials without reason,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Some of the things he says are not fit to be published because they are too vulgar and for someone of his stature it is not proper,&rdquo; Mufahore said, adding that &ldquo;the application against him was filed on Wednesday&rdquo;. She claimed that the demonstration against the local authority that was conducted in April was a plot by Mliswa to tarnish the council&rsquo;s image. Mufahore said the town&rsquo;s councillors have also approached Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere to assist in managing the Mliswa issue. However, Mliswa said he was unfazed by Mufahore&rsquo;s claims. &ldquo;This latest ploy is a desperate attempt to divert Norton&rsquo;s attention from demanding proper service delivery. The last kicks of a dying horse,&rdquo; he said on his Twitter account.
