HARARE - The Harare City Council (HCC) is doing a shoddy job on refurbishing roads, Transport minister Joram Gumbo has said. &ldquo;I realise that Chiremba Road was not properly repaired,&rdquo; Gumbo told the National Assembly last week. &ldquo;Those who are not repairing those roads properly are the City of Harare &mdash; they are doing a shoddy job. &ldquo;When we called for an emergency on the state of our roads, we worked with the minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing (Saviour) Kasukuwere, and we requested the president to declare it as a disaster, of which he did.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, we also requested for (State Procurement Board) SPB so that we bypass the tender procedure and we use those companies that are available in order for us to repair the roads in the whole country.&rdquo; Gumbo said other companies are doing well. &ldquo;The other companies that I am talking about that repair the roads are doing well.&nbsp; We did not look at the social status of people, whether they are wealthy or not, as a ministry we do not consider the social status. &ldquo;...our aim is to construct wider roads for areas where most people stay. I talked to Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (Zinara) ...that they should engage City of Harare to ensure the roads are repaired well. &ldquo;Our hope was that since the SPB has allowed us to take companies that are already there to address the road issue, these are the challenges that we have met. I agree with you and we are looking into it. We may decide to take away the tenders because it does not help in anyway.&rdquo;
