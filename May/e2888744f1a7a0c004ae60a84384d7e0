BULAWAYO - The Dumiso Dabengwa-led Zapu has been evicted from its Bulawayo offices over $11 000 rental arrears. The High Court here granted the eviction order against the opposition party. &ldquo;We occupied the offices in January 2015, having paid in cash nine months in advance, including a deposit,&rdquo; Zapu deputy spokesperson Iphithule Maphosa told the Daily News yesterday. &ldquo;After our coffers ran dry due to economic hardships . . . it became extremely difficult to raise the rentals of $1 000 every month. As a result, we accumulated arrears and it became difficult for us to settle,&rdquo; he said, adding &ldquo;that is why we didn&rsquo;t contest the eviction&rdquo;. He, however, further accused State security agents of interfering in the party&rsquo;s search for a new affordable home. &ldquo;We have a case where our would-be landlord had to withdraw the deal after having allegedly been threatened but that won&rsquo;t derail the people&rsquo;s project,&rdquo; Maphosa said. He said they will not allow the financial crisis to derail their mission to remove the Zanu PF government. &ldquo;We will soldier on, with or without the offices; we will never be diverted from our goal of delivering a free Zimbabwe through pushing the Zanu PF dictatorship out.&rdquo; Maphosa further noted that the party solely depended on its loyal members for bankrolling its day-to-day operations. He accused Zanu PF of suffocating the party by refusing to return its properties confiscated at the height of the post-independence civil war. Government seized numerous properties belonging to PF-Zapu, then led by nationalist and former vice president Joshua Nkomo, alleging that it had discovered arms caches. This is not the first time Zapu has been rendered &lsquo;&lsquo;homeless&rsquo;&rsquo;. In 2012, the party was evicted after failing to pay rent for over a year. Zapu has been dogged by financial problems since May 2009 when Dabengwa announced that the party was pulling out of its unity pact with President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s Zanu PF party.
