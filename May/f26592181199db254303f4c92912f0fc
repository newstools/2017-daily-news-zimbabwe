HARARE - ZPC KARIBA eased to the top of the Castle Lager Premiership log standings with a hard fought 2-1 victory over defending league champions CAPS United at Nyamhunga Stadium. Former Harare City striker Francesco Zekumbawira and Never Tigere scored the all-important goals for Sunday Chidzambwa&rsquo;s side as they handed the Green Machine their first defeat of the season while ensuring the power-utility side leapfrogged Ngezi Platinum Stars at the top of the log. ZPC Kariba are now on 18 points two better than second-placed Ngezi Platinum Stars after eight matches while Makepekepe remain on eighth place with nine points but have played two games less than the new log leaders. Forward Abbas Amidu had cancelled a Zekumbawira 20th minute opener just a minute from the break but Tigere scored the winner on the stroke of full time. Edmore Sibanda had tried his best to keep United in the game as he denied Raphael Manuvire from the penalty spot after defender Dennis Dauda was adjudged by the referee to have handled inside the box. The Green Machine, who have a congested fixture ahead of them will now have to quickly shift their focus to their Caf Champions league assignment. The Green Machine have a dose of good news after the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) instructed the Premier Soccer League (PSL) to cancel their match against Chicken Inn which was slated for Sunday at Luveve Stadium. Lloyd Chitembwe&rsquo;s charges need to bounce back against Algerian side USM Alger after their false start to their campaign which saw them lose 2-0 to Egyptian giants Zamalek, in Alexandria last week. The reigning league champions had done well to keep the White Knights at bay in the first half but were finally undone by two second half headers from Bassem Morsi and substitute Stanley Ohawuchi. That scenario has left the Green Machine in a must win scenario in their next game to keep their hopes of progressing to the knockout stages alive.
