BULAWAYO - Organisers of the Bulawayo Fashion Premier Show held last month handed over the proceeds to selected beneficiaries in the City of Kings on Wednesday. Spokesperson for the event Nomsa Ncube presented school fees and other necessities to students from King George VI Centre, Sizo Zimbabwe and Precious Life Foundation. &ldquo;The Bulawayo Fashion Premier Show was a success considering that it was just an initiative where each one of us provided their services for free just to assist the needy. &ldquo;It is such an initiative that revealed that given the right platform Zimbabweans can be united for a good cause. As a result, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all those who ensured the event was a success,&rdquo; Ncube said. In a bid to ensure transparency in the disbursement and handling of the proceeds, organisers of the Bulawayo Fashion Premier Show engaged the services of PNA Chartered Accountants. According to Ncube, the organisers are determined to attract more fashion houses and stakeholders next year. &ldquo;On this one, it was our first but we gave it our best. However, next year we want it to be bigger and better and we want to give ourselves more time unlike the two weeks we gave ourselves this time. I think it will be also good to hold the event during the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair,&rdquo; she added. The inaugural Bulawayo Fashion Premier showcased designs from fashion houses such as Shadow by Sidumiso, Njanji, Zah Designs, Kidd hunta, Bakhar, House of Mutu, Edgars Stores Collections, Femina Garments, Niki House of W.A.L and Eve-O Designs.
