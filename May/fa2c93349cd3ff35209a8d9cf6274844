HARARE - The Avenues Clinic has become the first hospital in the country to deliver a test tube baby in almost two decades after re-introducing In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) programme last year. IVF is a process in which an egg is fertilised by sperm outside the body and the fertilised egg is later implanted into a woman&rsquo;s uterus. The baby boy was born at 29 weeks on April 2, weighing just over a kilogramme.
