	MUTARE - A British national arrested in Chiadzwa Diamond Fields during Operation Hakudzokwi Commemoration has been freed by the Mutare Magistratesâ€™ Courts. 
	Rhiana Moses, 23, was released by magistrate Lazarus Murendo after securing $1 000 and a 72-hour temporary permit to vacate the country from the department of immigration.
	Moses was being charged with contravening the Immigration Act after it was discovered that she had overstayed in the country. 
	Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights represented her.
	Moses was on Saturday convicted of overstaying on her visa by two months and fined $100 before being caged pending deportation. 
	She escaped the embarrassment by making an urgent temporary permit to allow her to wind up her business and leave the country by Wednesday.
