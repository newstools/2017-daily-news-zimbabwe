	HARARE - Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Harare demanding the resignation of President Robert Mugabe. 
	The president’s grip on power was severely weakened on Wednesday when the Zimbabwe Defence Forces took power in order to “arrest criminals” surrounding the president. 
	Protesters are hugging soldiers in the crowd and cheering for them. 
	People are also converging at Zimbabwe Grounds in Highfield where an “Mugabe Must Go” rally organised by the war veterans and members of the ruling Zanu-PF party.
