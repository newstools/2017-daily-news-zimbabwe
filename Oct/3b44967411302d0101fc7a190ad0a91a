	HARARE - Ex-Test captain Brendan Taylor and pace bowler Kyle Jarvis are set to make their international cricket return after both were included in the 16-man Test squad to face West Indies in the two-match series that gets underway in Bulawayo this weekend. 
	Taylor penned a four-year contract putting an end to his Kolpak deal with English County side Nottinghamshire in order to resuscitate his international career with the Zimbabwe national team. 
	The 31-year-old asked to be released by Notts citing family commitments having deserted international cricket for a Kolpak contract with the side in March 2015. 
	Prior to his resignation, Taylor was the team’s leading run scorer with 433 runs at an average of 72.16 scoring two centuries against Ireland and India in Zimbabwe’s last two matches of the 2015 Wold Cup jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand. 
	Jarvis followed suit a week after Taylor, also putting to an end his Kolpak contract with Lancashire where he had been an integral part of the team taking wickets at regular interviews. 
	Australia-based top order batsman-cum-all-rounder Solomon Mire is also in line to making his Test debut and so is Mid West Rhinos wicket-keeper Nyasha Mayayo who also made it into the 16 that will be led by team captain Graeme Cremer. 
	The first Test gets underway at Queens Sports Club on Saturday and is expected to run until October 25 while the second and final match bowls off at the same venue from October 29 to November 2. 
	Zimbabwe Test Squad: 
	Graeme Cremer (Captain), Hamilton Masakadza, Solomon Mire, Chamu Chibhabha, Craig Ervine, Brendan Taylor, Sikandar Raza, Sean Williams, Malcolm Waller, Peter Moor, Regis Chakabva, Michael Chinouya, Christopher Mpofu, Kyle Jarvis, Tendai Chisoro, Nyasha Mayayo. 
	West Indies squad: Jason Holder (capt), Kraigg Brathwaite, Devendra Bishoo, Jermaine Blackwood, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich (wk), Shannon Gabriel, Shimron Hetmyer, Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Alzarri Joseph, Kieran Powell, Raymon Reifer, Kemar Roach.
