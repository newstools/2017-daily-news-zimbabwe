	HARARE - CAPS United coach Lloyd Chitembwe and striker Dominic Chungwa have won the Castle Lager Premiership monthly awards for September. 
	Makepekepe were in fine form during the month under review as they won four of the seven matches they played. 
	United began September with a 2-0 defeat against Dynamos in the Harare derby at the National Sports Stadium.

	However, they went on a good run following that defeat which pushed them up the PSL ladder to sixth place despite having been in the bottom third for long periods in the first half of the season. 
	They first picked up a crucial 1-1 draw against Bulawayo City on the road at Hartsfield Grounds before they beat Bantu Rovers 3-1. 
	On that day, captain Hardlife Zvirekwi scored a brace while Chungwa netted the other goal. 
	Chitembweâ€™s side returned to Harare where they were able to avenge the derby defeat to DeMbare with a 1-0 win at Rufaro Stadium with Chungwa scoring that solitary goal. 
	The green Machine travelled to Hwange where they beat the home side 1-0 courtesy of a John Zhuwawo strike in their next match. 
	Next up was 2015 champions Chicken Inn at home and Makepekepe were able to come out with a 1-0 win with Chungwa again grabbing the winning goal. 
	In their last league match, Makepekepe secured a crucial 1-1 draw away to title-chasing FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium. 
	On Sunday, CAPS resume their league action with a home encounter against Triangle at the National Sports Stadium. 
	With Chungwa in such fine form, the Green Machine will be hoping to pick up maximum points and continue with their resurgence.
