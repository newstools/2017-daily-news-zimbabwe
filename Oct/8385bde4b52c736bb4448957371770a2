	HARARE - Mashonaland Eagles avoided a potential upset after edging youthful Rising Stars by four-wickets on day three of the low-scoring four-day Logan Cup match at Takashinga Sports Club. 
	Eagles captain Tino Mutombodzi and Nathan Waller finished unbeaten on 36 and 56 respectively as the former champions reached 159/6 eclipsing the 155-run target set by Rising Stars. 
	The Harare-based franchise had reached 180 in their first innings with a one run lead after Rising Stars batted first and made 179 runs all out. 
	Once again batting woes let the new side down; a first innings 40 runs and 28 by Aarsh Jha and second innings’ 28 by William Mashinge and Mkhululi Nyathi’s 27 summed up the side’s struggles with the bat. 
	Their strength, the bowling department carried off from where they left last week against Mid West Rhinos in Kwekwe but their batters could not give them scores big enough to defend. 
	Seamer Blessing Muzarabani picked three wickets in either innings to exit the match with six wickets for 75 runs from 21 overs with Faraz Akram picking four wickets for 49 runs in 7.4 overs in the first innings while Mashinge claimed two wickets in each innings.
