HARARE - Zimbabwe coach Adam Chifo is frustrated after his side&rsquo;s three-wicket loss to Uganda in the final of the ICC World T20 Women&rsquo;s Africa Qualifiers at the Wanderers Cricket Ground in Windhoek, Namibia on Saturday. Without shouldering the blame on any of his players, Chifo paid homage to the ladies for putting up a decent performance winning all their four round-robin matches and booking a final berth against Uganda on the back of an impressive 100 percent winning record. Zimbabwe had been touted as the favourites to win the final and reach the Global Qualifiers which would have presented them with an opportunity to fight for a place at next year&rsquo;s ICC Women World Cup scheduled for West Indies but Uganda tore the form book apart to stun Chifo&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Out of the blues our batting failed to click. We struggled to build partnerships and we were lucky to get close to 100 after electing to bat first but 99 runs was always going to be very difficult to defend in the final,&rdquo; Chifo told the Daily News. &ldquo;The ladies had played some good cricket, everyone has got their bad day and it&rsquo;s unfortunate that for us it had to come on the very last day of the tournament. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s disappointing but there isn&rsquo;t much we can do about it now, they succumbed to big stage pressure, made some regrettable blunders but still pride of the way they accounted themselves despite faltering on the last hurdle.&rdquo; Chifo said they will now focus on the impending domestic cricket league and build towards future international assignments. &ldquo;For now all the focus will be on the domestic league and give the girls as much game time as possible, that&rsquo;s the only way we can improve,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was a good tournament, we would have loved to qualify but what we observed is that we are very much ahead in this region in terms of our standards of the game which was very much above the rest but credit to Uganda, they also had been doing their homework as well. &ldquo;Kenya used to be superior to Uganda but in this ended tournament they managed to beat them and went on to upset us in the final.&rdquo;
