PYONGYANG - The United Nations has imposed a fresh round of sanctions on North Korea after its sixth and largest nuclear test. The measures restrict oil imports and ban textile exports - an attempt to starve the North of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. The US had originally proposed harsher sanctions including a total ban on oil imports. The vote was only passed unanimously after Pyongyang allies Russia and China agreed to the reduced measures. The sanctions, which were passed at a UN Security Council meeting on Monday, were met with anger by North Korea. A statement on state news agency KNCA warned that if the US did eventually push through harsher sanctions, North Korea would &quot;absolutely make sure that the US pays due price&quot;.
